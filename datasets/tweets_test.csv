ENFJ|was finally proven to be BIGGER than the hate they tried to keep us down with. That’s all 💞 also feeling so thoughtful today so I’m rambling 😂
ENFJ|Also I wrote that tweet after watching a video a friend sent me of the streets celebrating in West Hollywood today, I broke down in tears of gratitude. I wanted to share that with you because the love I saw my queer community sharing between one another
ENFJ|Also - stop worrying what I tweet, BIDEN WON YALL 🥳🥳🥳😂😂😂
ENFJ|Remember when we didn’t all think the same? (It’s still happening) Opinions differ - I wasn’t commanding anyone to do anything. Now go out and celebrate or meme IF YOU PLEASE - DO YOU - all I’m saying is hatred DIDN’T work for the last administration ✌🏼
ENFJ|Look, y’all do what you want. I don’t normally tweet because it pisses someone off but I stopped caring a long time ago. Just trying to spread love and light today after all that is what we fought for right?
ENFJ|Today isn’t about celebrating in the face of those that oppose your views and values, but celebrating from a place of LOVE - combating the hate that has encompassed and oppressed so many of us the past four years. Let the healing begin. 🙏🏼
ENFJ|This was OUR election and WE WON TOGETHER. There’s still a lot of work to be done, but today we will celebrate each other.
ENFJ|Our 46th president, @joebiden!♥️🇺🇸🗳 I’ve been waiting to post this photo because I knew deep down you would be our next President. Today we celebrate the millions of Americans who overcame barriers to the ballot box, mobilized their communities , voted in record breaking numbers 
ENFJ|If you mailed in or dropped off your ballot please please PLEASE visit this link, find your state and verify that it was received and properly accepted💖📬 
ENFJ|Our democracy and freedom are worth waiting for. We must #CountEveryVote ‼️‼️ 
ENFJ|I’m not losing hope. My faith is strong. Just very disappointed at how close this is. Like. really y’all? 🤯🥺😔
ENFJ|Kind of terribly sad how close this election was. After this year and especially this summer it should’ve been a landslide. I don’t get it. Truly.
ENFJ|If you’ve already voted, text or call 3 friends and make sure they get out to vote today!! 💗 
ENFJ|You have the right to vote fairly and safely, but if you run into any issues call the National Voter Protection Hotline 833-336-8683🗳

ENFJ|This post isn’t about telling you to vote for, it’s about telling you to vote PERIOD. I want to know that whatever the outcome is, we raised our voices and spoke up for what we wanted. And if change is what you want, nothing will change unless you take action. 
ENFJ|I vote because I love my country. From my friends and family members who live here, to my neighbors and millions of people I don’t know, I love the citizens here. This year I’ve been so stressed and anxious from politics alone.

ENFJ|Not that anyone asked for this WHATSOEVER but I drink sooooo much more water when I add lemon to it so if anyone’s trying to drink more water - lemons help. And it’s also my current obsession. 😝
ENFJ|This is unfortunately the common reality with POC and we need to continue to raise the awareness of social injustice so that we can be the change that is not happening in our government. I love you TJ. I’m proud of you for speaking your truth.
ENFJ|This is my friend TJ. Honest, loyal, hilarious, intelligent and overall just a good dude. When he sent me this video I had tears streaming down my face.. what if something had happened to him years ago and I may have never met him? Or what if something were to happen now?

ENFJ|Do NOT pretend to know about someone’s mental illness if you do not personally know them. Check yourself.
ENFJ|It’s also amazing to me that people really think they actually know what some celebrities are going thru. Maybe take a step back and remember you don’t know everything about everyone even if you do watch them on tv
ENFJ|It would be nice if for once people can put down the meme making apps and pray for someone who’s struggling with mental illness. What happened to compassion?

ENFJ|Hey, you! American! Yes, you! This is your 1000th reminder to stop the scroll and go vote today 🇺🇸 ILY!
ENFJ|#VOTE
ENFJ|Vote #YesOn28 Arts and Music in Schools between now and this Tuesday, November 8th to give all students the chance to be creative.
ENFJ|I believe the arts open children’s minds + provide a new perspective on looking at the every day things in their lives. Research that we’ve done also shows that the arts support the positive growth of their mental health, which is the biggest thing on the line for this generation
ENFJ|Music helped open my narrow perspective on life , turned my world into 3D color. It changed my life , it’s important for me to pay that forward, which is what I’m doing with my Firework Foundation + Camp Firework, but barely 1 in 5 CA schools has a music/arts program. 
ENFJ|I answer all the hard hitting questions from my @LEGOGroup co-stars ✍🏻🧐 #LegoPartner Ad

ENFJ|if you wanna know why any human is they way they are, look at their parents participation or sadly, lack thereof. We are all just patterns of them but at a certain conscious age we have to ask ourselves will I be repeating this pattern or will I be the loop breaker?

ENFP|Soviet Union collapses in 1991. U.S. arms merchants move NATO to sensitive Russian borders in return for huge arms sales to those Eastern European countries. In 2022, Russia invades Ukraine and shows how hollow/weak its military is. Result? More arms sales to those countries

ENFP|Another huge exemption off the table by Biden and the GOP’s debt limit deal hundreds of billions of dollars annually of corporate welfare—subsidies, giveaways, bailouts, and other taxpayer freebies to the giant corporate freeloaders. Untouchable govt. corporate capitalism. -R
ENFP|Corporatist Republicans are playing cash register politics. Remember them in November 2024. They let you down. They don’t care about people. They just want to give your power and your money to giant corporations who fill their pockets with campaign cash. -R
ENFP|Congressional Republicans want to cut everything dealing with the peoples’ well being and shield profiteering giant corporations from paying their fair share of taxes and the military industrial complex which is taking over the government. -R
ENFP|He could have exposed what the GOP corporatists are all about Cash register politics for big business and cuts for the programs benefiting all the people in health, education and other necessities of life. -R
ENFP|Biden could have conveyed that the Republicans want to take it out of the peoples hide, and put the money in the tax escapes and the swollen military budget which lines the pockets of corporate contractors
ENFP|Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee asked leader Hakeem Jeffries to urge Biden to have a national television speech explaining what the GOP want to do to this country as they hold Uncle Sam hostage on the debt limit issue. Too bad he didn’t listen
ENFP|That leaves the GOP getting their cuts from necessary domestic programs like education, health, environment and worker safety. -R
ENFP|Why was the bloated, redundant military budget off limits in the debt limit negotiations between the militaristic GOP and Joe Biden? That’s over half the federal operating budget. Untouchable. Full of contractor rip offs and corruption.
ENFP|Biden has conceded cuts to the already starved IRS budget demanded by Republicans who have long aided and abetted tax evasion by the super-rich and giant corporations. Congress—don’t cave and make millions of Americans unable to get calls returned by the IRS for weeks on end. -R
ENFP|All this trouble the Democrats are having over GOP corporatist debt limit demands could have been avoided had they listened to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen last fall who presciently urged lifting the debt limit while they controlled Congress. Pathetically short sighted. -R

ENFP|Why hasn’t Israel disposed of them preemptively? Israel doesn’t wait when it sends many bombing sorties over Syria and other defenseless, neighboring countries? Because the Israeli government needs these rockets to justify smashing Gaza and its exposed civilians.
ENFP|The Israeli Air Force is again striking rocket manufacturing workshops and rocket launch sites in tiny Gaza. These locations are long known to Israeli intense surveillance and informers down to every garage assembling these primitive rockets.

ENFP|You reflect the contradictory mind set of some other CEOs over the years concisely described with the words – He said No but Took the Dough! -R
ENFP|One last bit of advice, Elon. You have come out against government subsidies in your public statements. Yet you keep demanding or accepting them – and more is on the way – nonetheless.
ENFP|You might also reduce your frantic tweeting rate and pay more attention to the loss of life and limb occasioned by deceptive assurances for your greatly over-priced Tesla Full Self Driving feature, now under regulatory recall action by @NHTSAgov.
ENFP|The least that you can do is correct yourself. Every April 15th you should also publically thank the American taxpayer for helping to make you so rich.
ENFP|You makes demands on states everywhere you build or intend to build plants – some for your SpaceX venture, some for your SolarCity plant in Buffalo, which double-dipped NY State and federal taxpayers to build and equip the facility. For more examples see 
ENFP|The record is clear – billions of dollars in federal and state grants, direct and indirect tax credits, $1.3 billion in tax concessions and other incentives from the state of Nevada alone for a new factory in 2014.
ENFP|To the Grandmaster of Tweetitis Credit to you for breaking the auto industrys technological stagnation with Tesla. But to deny that your companies do not receive continual federal and state subsidies – apart from overseas governmental largesse – is to deny reality.
ENFP|Musk (@elonmusk) started Tesla with a huge U.S. government welfare grant. He has taken taxpayers to the cleaners for his factories and for Starlink. He is a gigantic corporate welfare king masquerading as a capitalist businessman. -R
ENFP|and its people to this day and taken over a million Iraqi lives. The media didn’t make much of the 10th anniversary. Let’s hope they don’t repeat this conscious neglect. -R
ENFP|The mass media is focusing big time on the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Let’s see if they focus on the 20th anniversary (March 19, 2023) of George W. Bush and Dick Cheney’s unconstitutional and illegal invasion of Iraq that has devastated that country
ENFP|News reports say Jimmy Carter has entered hospice. The most determined peace negotiating, scandal-free, wise, hardworking president of our time. Also, the greatest ex-president of all. I hope he leaves a farewell address to the American people. -R @CarterCenter
ENFP|What is called economic nationalism has taken over and countries are not even bringing cases against one another because they are doing the same thing. For more details about the decline and fall of the WTO and its tribunals, follow @WallachLori. -R
ENFP|From its inception the World Trade Organization has frequently been violated with impunity by various nations across the planet. In the last few years, the violations have turned into a rout. There’s hardly anything left of the restrictions placed on trade barriers by the WTO.

ENFP|Clearly, its not the negative connotation of words that the House is worried about. Its the positive action of labor for dignified livelihoods, health and safety that troubles them and that they seek to circumvent with the word workforce. -R
ENFP|House Republicans have taken the word labor out of the House education and labor committee. Why? They say the word labor carries a negative connotation that ignores the dignity of work. At the same time, they stripped the right to unionize from their own staffers.
ENFP|Outlaw, militarist and corporatist Donald Trump is reinventing his rhetoric. He is now boosting Social Security and Medicare. Posing as the peace candidate to resolve the war in Ukraine. There will be more makeovers coming, including painting the Democrats as the War Party. -R

ENFP|First, Democrats should fire their corporate conflicted political consultants and then look at themselves in the mirror for a serious evaluation of their preventable losses. -R
ENFP|The Dems should have runaway won this election against the worst GOP in history. But they only seriously contested 5 of 20 open GOP Senate seats. They then proceeded to lose 4 seats for the House in NY State which they politically dominate. Other examples of failures abound

ENFP|This is only a piece of the NY Times over-visualization of its newspaper, which is taking over the news feature, business and editorial pages. Pictures good up to a point. Beyond that, they replace too much content. Are serious readers of the Times entitled to your response? -R

ENFP|By the way. Trump, the failed gambling czar, proposed cutting the CDC and NIH budgets by 20% and the U.S. contribution to WHO by 50% in his 2020 budget sent to Congress. Sheer madness. -R
ENFP|The CDC budget is about $8B a year. You can imagine its massive national and international obligations. Recently, Apple’s profits from their gouging prices led to it announcing $90B of unproductive stock buybacks. Another cf. between public necessity and corporate greed. -R
ENFP|Half of all colleges have dropped the SAT or ACT requirements for the fall of 2021. In 1980, our report, The Reign of ETS The Corporation That Makes Up Minds by @AllanNairn14 documented both drawbacks and biases of standardized tests. It’s about time. -R
ENFP|Democrats use two words describing GOP moves against certain voters—voter suppression. Why not GOP state bureaucracies are over-regulating voters, criminalizing peaceful street protests against them, and exposing volunteer precinct workers to frivolous govt. prosecutions. -R
ENFP|own stock to elevate executive compensation metrics. She also opposes restoring the corporate tax rate to pre-Trump levels in order to pay for this program. -R
ENFP|Senator Susan Collins (@SenatorCollins) said that $2 trillion of President Biden’s physical and human infrastructure program is an enormous sum of money over the next eight years. She hasn’t spoken out on the trillions that big corporations have misspent buying back their
ENFP|When is @JoeBiden going to nominate a @NHTSAgov auto safety administrator? It’s almost June and this vital agency has no Senate confirmed leader. Why the delay? -R
ENFP|Wonder how much effort Senate Democrats are putting into spinning off some GOP Senators from total McConnell control. Only takes a few GOP Senators to get important legislation enacted. Start with GOP friends of Delaware Senators @SenatorCarper and @ChrisCoons. -R
ENFP|Senator @amyklobuchar and Congressman @davidcicilline want to break up the big social media conglomerates. They seek antitrust enforcement in the courts. That’s at least 12 years delay. Why not legislation breaking them up by name? Learn from Public Utility Holding Act of 1935 -R
ENFP|Why are the Democrats so slow in confirming three nominees for the postal system board of governors? They need them to fulfill a pledge to fire Postmaster General and Trump accomplice Louis DeJoy. DeJoy has been wrecking the post office for over a year. Dithering Democrats. -R
ENFP|Anthropologist Laura Nader on the Lost Art of the Letter - 
ENFP|Jonathan Brown, consumer advocate who influenced housing and banking policies, dies at 76 
ENFP|Yankees couldnt have chosen better than to have Corey Kluber throw a no hitter against the Texas Rangers on Wednesday night. Years ago, George W. Bush manipulated the Rangers company for over $12 million. A tax-funded stadium was involved. -R
ENFP|Why do health officials in the media keep using words like spreading and transmitting the Covid-19 virus? The old fashioned word used to be contagious. Using the word contagious might get more people to focus on wearing masks and maintaining social distance. -R
ENFP|U.S. House lawmakers seek Boeing, FAA records after production problems 
ENFP|On the latest Radio Hour, Ralph talks to former IRS commissioner John Koskinen about what must be done to create a fairer tax system. And Columbia University Professor Rashid Khalidi on Israels violent escalation in Gaza. 
ENFP|Without these crude, unguided rockets, what pretext would Netanyahu have for Biden as he destroys Gazas civilian infrastructure and families? -R
ENFP|Can the experienced investigative reporters like Sy Hersh, @jeremyscahill and @MaxBlumenthal tell the American people the fuller story of this strange omission over the years of the omnipresent, precision Israeli Air Force? -R
ENFP|NYT reports The trouble started on Monday, when a heavy-handed police raid at Jerusalem’s Al Aqsa Mosque — the third-holiest site in Islam set off an instant backlash. Still, cowardly Biden talks as if Israel is under attack instead of being the overwhelming attacker. -R
ENFP|Experts say it takes less than five seconds for Israeli missiles to detect the source of a launched crude rocket. What’s the explanation? -R
ENFP|With precision surveillance technology, spies and informants, Israel knows every alley, every street and who is in which homes and apartment buildings in tiny Gaza. Strange they don’t know where the crude garage-built rockets are located
ENFP|Violating clear international law, Israel is militarily controlling and colonizing what’s left of Palestine’s West Bank. Also illegal is Israels embargo and siege of Gaza. Also illegal is seizure of Palestinian water and land by the Israeli govt. Biden/Pelosi think that’s OK. -R
ENFP|Biden, Pelosi and other AIPAC Democrats are engaging in the other antisemitism—antisemitism against Arabs. After 73 years of looking the other way, its time for the first Congressional hearings featuring Israeli and Palestinian peace advocates. -R
ENFP|Once again, Netanyahus govt is slaughtering Palestinian Arabs in Gaza for political reasons to avoid a 5th election, and to impede his pending prosecution. Once again, Biden/Pelosi show no compassion to the mounting Palestinian civilian fatalities, using U.S. weapons and aid.-R
ENFP|Ralph talks to @KenReedLofF on the League of Fans’ Sports Forum podcast about baseball, spectator sports vs. participatory sports, the decline of phys-ed in schools, concussions and CTE, in-game advertising and more. 
ENFP|Eric Lipton of the New York Times (@EricLiptonNYT) has to be considered one of the great reporters in the country. For years, he gives us the facts that are rarely brought together for greater understanding. His latest is on cryptocurrency. -R 
ENFP|George W. Bush’s book of portraits of immigrants is a bestseller. Yet he refused to let in Iraqi immigrants. Many of them were drivers and interpreters for the U.S. military. Defenseless, they were later slaughtered by militias. He’s shameless and remorseless. -R
ENFP|The New York Times sports editor is Randal Archibold. @randyNYT. Yankees fans, Mets fans, send him a message. -R
ENFP|The day after Sunday’s daytime baseball games, the @NYTSports editor covers the first two pages with European soccer stories, and leaves the rest of the section without any baseball coverage. Week after week, the guy must think readers want more and more Euro soccer stories. -R
ENFP|Ralph talks to MIT professor, Nicholas Ashford, who, to stem the tide of lies and misinformation amplified by broadcast media, pitches a new Fairness Doctrine. Plus, Prof. Lonnie T. Brown and filmmaker Joseph Stillman on the legacy of Ramsey Clark. 
ENFP|Reporter’s Alert Part V 
ENFP|Let’s hope they learn from past procurement scandals. -R
ENFP|With trillions of dollars streaming out to the country in stimulus and relief programs, many contracts will be signed with corporations. Are the Bidenites reserving some funds for rigorous audits and investigating to catch the inevitable waste, fraud and abuse? CC @WHCOS
ENFP|He advocated basic democratic values necessary for an enlightened, just society. His remarkable productive life, from humble origins, invites a top-flight biographer. -R
ENFP|Vartan Gregorian, who passed away recently, was a great public citizen. Coming to the U.S. as an immigrant from Armenia to enroll at Stanford, he went on to become the savior of the NY Public Library, the president of Brown University, and the head of the Carnegie Corporation

ENFP|Hello Eric! Xx @EricIdle
ENFP|Feel free to do so. How are yours?
ENFP|May I just say, dear @nytimes , that the great Bob Gottlieb did not publish The Satanic Verses, as your obituary notice incorrectly says. He published Midnight’s Children and Shame. TSV was published by Peter Mayer at Viking. Please correct?
ENFP|Good luck !
ENFP|This has come back to haunt me before. 😊 In my defence, I was young and needed the money.
ENFP|One of the very best and most generous reviews, by #JeetThayil via @thewirein

ENFP|He was a self confessed antisemite, with pronounced racist leanings, and he joined in the attack on me back in 1989… but thanks for telling me off for defending his work from the bowdlerizing Sensitivity Police.
ENFP|Beautiful review in the Indian Express. Thank you @nilanjanaroy !
ENFP|Roald Dahl was no angel but this is absurd censorship. Puffin Books and the Dahl estate should be ashamed.
ENFP|Very nice.
ENFP|Did you notice the two shopkeeper brothers named Narayan and Laxman?
ENFP|Yes, and it’s also a reference to Sir John Oldcastle, whom Shakespeare later renamed Falstaff, and who was a drunkard too.

ENFP|Midnight’s Children was published 40 years ago this week. Here’s a picture of me, in a daze, making some sort of speech after winning the Booker Prize later that year. (Sorry about the cigarette.) 
ENFP|This is a terrific piece of work. I was fascinated and learned a lot. Watch it if you can.
ENFP|A great loss today. Rest, poet. Your work will live.
ENFP|Yes. Unlike this ordinary tape, which, as you see, you can see.
ENFP|I also once had Mr Cleese in a commercial for Scotch tape.
ENFP|The egg was by Fay Weldon. Naughty but nice and Adorabubble were me.
ENFP|A fan speaks.
ENFP|Here’s the 40th anniversary edition, with a new introduction by me.
ENFP|I’d like that very much. There’s the little matter of the global pandemic, but once we have come through the nightmare, then yes, it’s high on my list.
ENFP|I’m sorry you chose to quote my one small reservation about books by a writer I love, and who was a good friend. The LRB article below is immensely laudatory. (I, too, have read many more books by Calvino than by Rushdie.)
ENFP|Once upon a time the book pirates were doing so well out of stealing my stuff that they used to send me greetings cards. Happy new year - the pirates. Etc.

ENFP|Thank you!
ENFP|I’m very happy that so many of you have enjoyed / appreciated this. Merry Christmas!
ENFP|I’m so pleased.
ENFP|Do you imagine that I have never experienced racism? If so you are mistaken. The debate about free speech vs racist language is too complex for Twitter. Thanks for your tweet, though.

ENFP|Published today. #SeeingTheBody @rachelelizag - beautiful book.
ENFP|Thank you. I was very happy to see this.
ENFP|Here’s something I just wrote.
ENFP|You can dish it out but you cant take it, huh.
ENFP|If you want better reviews, there are plenty of good ones. But a better idea is to throw away the reviews and just see what you think of the book. Thanks for reading.
ENFP|Thanks. I’ve seen at least three scholarly papers discussing the eyes, but I enjoyed Julian’s thoughts on the subject, that’s all.
ENFP|According to Julian Barnes in Flaubert’s Parrot, Madame Bovary’s eyes change color a number of times in the book.
ENFP|I’ve spoken in Cambridge many times since then! Hope you managed to get to one of those events.
ENFP|Dear Gabe, I’m so glad you’re enjoying my Haroun and congrats on your excellent opposite paragraph!
ENFP|That’s actually isn’t how it begins, but a sentence patched together from different parts of the first page. The book’s publisher should know better than to misquote the book.
ENFP|Sorry, I dont remember. Are you thinking of The Idea of Empire, documentary about Edward, made in 1993? Cant recall now if Eqbal was part of that. Directed by Tim May and Frank Hanly.
ENFP|Just dive in! Enjoy!
ENFP|You’re right about two things. That’s a fake quote - it’s nothing I ever said. And I don’t consider myself a Muslim. The rest no comment. And goodbye.
ENFP|This isn’t exactly right. Long ago I met various people who claimed they had worked on such novels. I have no idea if they really exist. I suspect they don’t.
ENFP|Well if you want the detail, at that time Dyer was an officer in the British Indian Army which did use the term Brigadier General.
ENFP|At the time of the massacre Dyer was a temporary Brigadier General.
ENFP|Yes, rifles. That mistake has been sitting in the text since 1981. I should fix it. Thanks.
ENFP|My old friend Rosanne Hodin has written a delightful and funny memoir of her familys crazy life in the English countryside. Perfect escapist reading for these locked-down times. #growinggoatsandgirls 
ENFP|@PGourevitch Very sorry to see this Philip. Sending love.
ENFP|Very probable. Sounds right. It’s a long time ago and I’m afraid I don’t remember.
ENFP|Thanks. But don’t hold your breath.
ENFP|Yes. In writing QUICHOTTE for example I was helped by two SF stories, one by Arthur C. Clarke, the other by Katherine MacLean. Details in acknowledgments.
ENFP|Yes. You should apply to the Emory Manuscripts and Rare Book Library (MARBL).
ENFP|Yes. I think I made up the Robert part too.
ENFP|Reshevsky published a number of excellent books about chess but I think I may have made this one up.
ENFP|Keep turning the pages.
ENFP|Amongst other books, yes, certainly.
ENFP|Not a mistake. Giuliani and Koch are both former mayors of New York. So, yes, a sort of joke.
ENFP|Yes! I remember reading the Gavaskar story in the paper not long after the novel came out and was amazed at the parallels.
ENFP|Thank you for reading! Re influences, I haven’t read the Blind Musician book, and Suskind’s Perfume was published 4 years after Midnight’s Children.
ENFP|Fake account @OfficialRushdie. That is not me. This is.
ENFP|This brilliant book is out early June. Pre-order! Buy! Read! It’s beautiful, passionate, astonishing.

ENFP|Thank you
ENFP|It was for Baby Softo talcum powder I believe.
ENFP|Really? The only copy I write in my life ? In that case I wonder why ad agencies kept paying me all those years.
ENFP|Excellent writer, terrific book.
ENFP|No I haven’t read it but thank you - I will look for an English translation.
ENFP|Surely that was the first draft of Romeo (and Juliet )?
ENFP|Neither theory justifies @DalrympleWill’s flamboyant assertion.
ENFP|Has @DalrympleWill seen the first draft of Hamlet? And he knows that there was a second draft? This could revolutionize Shakespeare scholarship.

ENFP|An enormously positive review in the Irish Independent and a friendly profile/interview in the (UK) Times. Both behind paywalls, so suffice to say I’m delighted and grateful. Old Quichotte is (so far) enjoying a gentle ride into the world.
ENFP|@manubhatt3 No.
ENFP|Good advice. Ive read the book.
ENFP|@myklreinhart Thanks, yes, I know. Just a slip.
ENFP|Thanks, yes, it was an excerpt - a few passages from different parts of the book put together to read as a self contained story. I hope you enjoy the full-length version!
ENFP|Thank you. I have no plans to be done. But right now, Im about to be on book tour for Quichotte (pronounced key-SHOT, in case people are still wondering), so no time to write much
ENFP|Im happy about the almost.

ENFP|And now here’s my first copy of the UK edition! (This cover will also be used in India.) 
ENFP|I suspect the mighty Cervantes will survive my friend Martin’s critique. As for my Quichotte, the early reviews have been very kind. So far, so good.

ENFP|Thats so nice. Thank you. 
ENFP|Oh dear. Somebody got out of bed on the wrong side today. 
ENFP|I havent heard about this - but I am not good at doing what Im told, and I dont think other writers are, either. 
ENFP|This is good news. Thanks. Shalimar opera (music @jackperla words @RajivAJoseph) premieres next Saturday! @OTSL 
ENFP|Photobombed by @ZafRushdie 
ENFP|Glad we finally made it on to the same page 
ENFP|Everyones a critic. 
ENFP|Excellent news 
ENFP|Yes. And wrong. Shame on the Guardian. But at least it published Amit Chaudhuris fine piece on Bhupen 10 days ago. 
ENFP|Wonderful Bhupen Khakhar show opened at @Tate Modern tonight. This is us w/ our Bhupen. @MilanRushdie @ZafRushdie 
ENFP|I call it learning by heart, not rote learning. Because it affects the heart. 
ENFP|Thanks for this. Clearly there was an initial inquiry, but no offer Im aware of, no agreement, no permission. 
ENFP|Very odd. My agents checked, , confirm that no request to adapt this novel for the stage was received from Denmark. 
ENFP|We never received any request to stage this adaptation. No permission was given. This cancellation is a mystery. 
ENFP|Correction I have seen one grammar and composition book, the great Strunk and White, but Id still prefer people read Charlottes Web.
ENFP|Not a fan of Mr Galloway. I prefer Mrs Dalloway. 
ENFP|I dont think I have ever seen a grammar and composition book. Read English-language literature instead. Good luck! 
ENFP|Ha! Did ancient Romans (Latin industria) also know about Indus?Also as its Darya-e-Sind shouldnt it be Sindustry? 
ENFP|OK, Ill desist. But which page of my novel features a portrait of you? My lips are sealed. Answers on a postcard. 
ENFP|Great evening , delicious food - thank you!

ENFP|It was so much fun! Brilliant stories. 
ENFP|She may not be the nicest person in the world, Im afraid. Sad but true. 
ENFP|Great company. Joyce and Conrad changed my life too. 
ENFP|Thats not learning. 
ENFP|Good.I was supposed to be a physicist but jumped ship , became a novelist instead. Still interested in the universe. 
ENFP|Geology is better. The novels are pretty stratified. 
ENFP|Wrong class. Im not remotely sociological. Try a novel, maybe. 
ENFP|@sree great to meet them too!

ENFP|Everybody (especially young adults but, really, everybody) should read Jumans wonderful book. 
ENFP|Thanks for the ride in from the airport! 
ENFP|Would it be wrong to think that there might be a reason for buying my book that is not related to Khomeini? 
ENFP|So It would appear the president bought my book today. For Obama, a new shopping haunt Upshur Street Books 
ENFP|Mysterious. I myself hadnt heard this, and will be in Mexico. Must be some other midnights child. 
ENFP|This admission just took 27 years. How many more before the mistake is corrected?

ENFP|Thank you it was fun even without any hot liquid for the throat 
ENFP|Thank you all for the conversation on this sad day. Im off now.
ENFP|Whoa. Did you forget to take your meds? 
ENFP|The true voice of the religion of tolerance and open discourse. 
ENFP|Agreed. Wahhabi/Salafi Islam, once a fanatical fringe cult, is now taking over the mainstream, funded by Saudis. 
ENFP|Great grief for the fallen, anger at the fanaticism that has created a vile mutation in the heart of Islam, , contempt for the but brigade.
ENFP|Thanks 😘 
ENFP|Who do I have to be? Heres a thing you need to understand about FoE everyone gets to speak. Even fools like you. 
ENFP|Thank you Houston. What a nice evening! @InprintHouston

ENFP|Well, nor am I. For some reason. 
ENFP|Just saw the schedule. Looking forward to this! @MobyDickNYC 
ENFP|Very funny , long ago how two words from me helped Michael Chabon become a very intelligent parrot. 
ENFP|Hahaha 
ENFP|Answers are in the book. Also a Google search would help or the Amazon page or my website. This is the internet. 
ENFP|I published it 3 years ago. The title is Joseph Anton. It is quite widely available. Hope curiosity satisfied. 
ENFP|Check your chronology. Shame published years before Lajja. She just chose to use the same title. Dont ask me why. 
ENFP|Good advice. 
ENFP|I have 3 trans of 1001Nights , looked at them all. My book not really based on it, its just that kind of story.

ENFP|Anyway, bye for now, folks, Just to repeat In 40 days, Two Years Eight Months and Twenty-Eight Nights will be out there in the world.
ENFP|What is this old man shit? And re tough English, maybe stick to hyphenated books printed on board? 
ENFP|You have to read the book to find out. 
ENFP|Re your % (From @nayanikaaa) Even if its his worst, will still be better than 99.9% of the books in any bookshop. 
ENFP|Can someone translate this into English? I suspect its rude but I cant understand it so I cant be sure. 
ENFP|Re your ?, its the title of a book Ive written. Thanks for asking.

ENFP|There will never be a sequel. I promise. 
ENFP|Dont think Ill be reading Go Set Your Watch or whatever its called. I have unpublished juvenilia too, would cringe if it got published.
ENFP|My very talented friends @FazeelatAslam and @jgoldy492 worked around the clock on this film about #EricGarner.

ENFP|A polite exchange with @IndiaExplained, a friendly conclusion why is it news? How on earth is it a free speech issue?Get over it, Twitter.
ENFP|Yes, once, but it was almost 40 years ago. 
ENFP|OK, September book tour in US/Canada just about set. Additional US cities later in the year, also other countries.

ENTJ|What an incredible life and legacy. I feel lucky to have worked with Bob on two books. He managed to be a champion for both the writer and the reader. He didnt want anything more than to help the book be the best possible version of itself. 
ENTJ|Solving problems like climate change, health inequity and food insecurity requires innovation. From developing malaria drugs to investing in climate adaptation, China has a lot of experience in that. We need to unlock that kind of progress for more people around the world.
ENTJ|The world was making huge progress in reducing child deaths and poverty, but global crises set us back. African countries are particularly vulnerable, with high food prices, crushing debt, and increasing rates of TB and malaria. That’s why I’m heading to West Africa next.
ENTJ|I’ve just landed in Beijing for the first time since 2019, where I’m excited to visit with partners who have been working on global health and development challenges with @gatesfoundation for more than 15 years.

ENTJ|I loved learning about exciting research underway at @jaramillogroup to convert water and carbon dioxide into fuels and fertilizer 
ENTJ|It’s hard for even the most promising low-carbon technologies to make it all the way to market. The @Breakthrough Energy Fellows program empowers early-stage innovators like @MoltenInd to grow from their garage and deliver the solutions the world needs to get to zero emissions.
ENTJ|Progress in health, climate, and education is driven by impatient optimists. Great read by @HannahRitchie. 
ENTJ|I was blown away by the creativity and ingenuity at @stanforddoerr to meet the energy and sustainability challenges of today and the future. 
ENTJ|The @Breakthrough Fellows program supports brilliant scientists working on early-stage climate technologies. Last week, I got to meet the second cohort of fellows and learn about the work theyre doing to help the world achieve net-zero emissions. 
ENTJ|This #WorldTeachersDay, I’m thinking about Mrs. Caffiere. She was the school librarian at Seattle’s View Ridge Elementary. When I was 9 years old, she took me under her wing and taught me that my love of reading was a strength. To this day, I think about how she changed my life. 
ENTJ|After my visit to the @stanforddoerr school of sustainability, I’m even more optimistic that we can develop breakthroughs that will transform our global economy, our lives, and our planet for the better 
ENTJ|I was truly lucky to know Ric Weiland. He was an incredible programmer and an exceptional individual. 
ENTJ|Over the years, I’ve come to know Bono as an incredible storyteller and friend. I’m excited for the world to see him the same way.
ENTJ|Thanks for dedicating your career to keeping the world informed, @edyong209. I hope you have a restful sabbatical.
ENTJ|The world can end this pandemic while also preventing the next. As @edyong209 shares, such changes seem unrealistic given the relentless disappointments of the past three years, but substantial social progress always seems unfeasible until it is actually achieved.
ENTJ|A moving story about the universal power of books. 
ENTJ|Congratulations @Trevornoah on the incredible run. I always enjoy the fun conversations and especially loved playing tennis with you in Cape Town. I know you’ve only just begun and can’t wait to see what you do next.
ENTJ|Very fun to learn more about the new youth world champion of my favorite pastime. Here’s a belated congratulations, Anshul Bhatt! 
ENTJ|Leaders like @wiiiiza make me optimistic for our future. Earlier this year, I had the opportunity to meet Farwiza and was so impressed by her work protecting the Leuser ecosystem in Indonesia.
ENTJ|Thanks for bringing levity to such a serious issue yesterday, @kalpenn. I learned a lot from @noupside and @govindethiraj about how we can be better consumers of information and rebuild trust in institutions. 
ENTJ|@UlrichJvV @gatesfoundation @GatesAfrica I think everyone was thankful I wasnt the lead chef. Ill be thinking of @ChefPierreThiams salad and conversation for days.
ENTJ|#Goalkeepers2030 was filled with laughter, impactful storytelling, and innovative ideas that left me feeling inspired. 
ENTJ|This month, we’re committing $912 million to help replenish the Global Fund through 2026 to expand access to health services around the world and build resilient health systems to prevent future pandemics in the #FightForWhatCounts. 
ENTJ|I’ve long said that the @GlobalFund is one of the kindest things people have ever done for one another. It’s also one of the most effective. Programs supported by the Global Fund have reduced the death toll from AIDS, TB, and malaria by 50%, saving more than 50M lives.
ENTJ|It was an honor to see you this morning. Supporting @globalfund builds a healthier, safer world – it’s the kindest thing we can do for one another.
ENTJ|What a night. It’s rare to have so many heroes in one place. #Goalkeepers2030 
ENTJ|I had a chance to connect with @ClimateEnvoy John Kerry to kick off #ClimateWeekNYC. We’re both optimistic about recent momentum to accelerate the clean energy transition. 
ENTJ|One of my favorite things about Bono is that he loves a good surprise. We had the chance to photobomb @ONEinAmerica activists, hear their @GlobalFund campaign stories, and share the latest progress in malaria research. #FightForWhatCounts 
ENTJ|For the first time since 2019, the Goalkeepers community is coming together in person. I’m excited to spend time with them and hear about their innovative work to drive progress. #Goalkeepers2030 
ENTJ|Congratulations on a phenomenal career. Time to celebrate! 
ENTJ|Youve been an incredible friend to me and an inspiration to an entire generation of tennis players. Im lucky to have seen you work your magic on the court many times. And Im excited to watch your philanthropic work grow in this next phase of your life.
ENTJ|New ways to prevent and treat malaria are within reach. They’ll make it possible—with the right funding and commitment—to end malaria. 
ENTJ|Providing aid to hungry communities is essential—but it’s not enough to end food insecurity. We also need innovation to create self-sustaining food systems. 
ENTJ|Economic inequality is one of the biggest barriers to gender equality. True equality depends not only on a woman’s ability to access money, but also on her ability to fully control it. 
ENTJ|Seven years ago, world leaders agreed to 17 ambitious goals to reduce inequality by 2030. The 2022 Goalkeepers report is an essential update on the progress. #Goalkeepers2030 
ENTJ|hint it has the juice
ENTJ|Which crop that is highly sensitive to climate change accounts for around 30% of all the calories people in sub-Saharan Africa eat? You can find the answer here 
ENTJ|We are at a turning point in the world’s progress on some of the most fundamental challenges facing humanity. Here’s what world leaders need to do to ensure a better future. #Goalkeepers2030 
ENTJ|There are so many reasons to be hopeful. Innovations that reduce the burden of disease on children are just some of the many that keep me optimistic. 
ENTJ|This is great. New Jersey is setting a new standard by taking climate curriculum one step further – not just telling students what’s happening, but also asking them what the world can do about it. 
ENTJ|Pneumonia is the leading cause of death in children under 5. Inventprise is working to change that 
ENTJ|I feel honored to have met HM Queen Elizabeth, and I am very sad to hear of her passing. My deepest condolences to the Royal Family and the British people.
ENTJ|Germany is a leading voice in the fight against HIV, TB, and malaria. Once again, theyre stepping up by increasing their pledge to the @GlobalFund. Germanys commitment to the #FightForWhatCounts will help save millions of lives.
ENTJ|I love learning about the brain. Here’s cool research on the brains GPS. 
ENTJ|This is the toughest question I’ve ever had to answer 
ENTJ|What a run. @serenawilliams will be leaving behind an extraordinary tennis career that challenged the double standard between male and female players. I look forward to watching her continue building her amazing legacy off the court. 
ENTJ|This Nerd(le)’s day was just made.
ENTJ|Interesting research on public perception of climate change. 
ENTJ|If you’ve played Wordle, you know how important your first guess is. Here’s my strategy 
ENTJ|Here’s how I’ve started every day since February. #Wordle 
ENTJ|Life is more fun when you have a friend like Warren. Happy 92nd birthday! 
ENTJ|Summer’s almost over. If you have time to sneak in another book or two – here are a few I recommend. 
ENTJ|We’re so grateful for Japan’s generosity. We all have a part to play in the #FightForWhatCounts ending AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria and building resilient health systems that will keep us safe from future pandemics.
ENTJ|Interesting findings from @zearned on how to tackle learning disruptions from COVID-19 and help all kids move forward in their math learning. 
ENTJ|It’s encouraging that there’s more public support for taking big steps to avoid a climate disaster than ever before. My book suggests a lot of ideas – and it’s now available in paperback 
ENTJ|It’s easy to forget how scary polio was in the United States and around the world. This is a powerful reminder. 
ENTJ|Damaris Matoke-Muhia is changing the fight against malaria and gender inequity. And her personal story is phenomenal. 
ENTJ|I cannot agree with @DrHamidJafari more women vaccinators are vitally important in reaching every last child with polio vaccines. Thank you to @JenJonesRotary and everyone in the @Rotary community for continuing to support the effort to #EndPolio for good.
ENTJ|Last year, I laid out a plan for eliminating greenhouse gas emissions. This year, there’s more momentum than ever before. How to Avoid a Climate Disaster is now available in paperback. 
ENTJ|In the past 16 years the world has made immense strides in protecting children from life-threatening diarrhea. Today, I congratulate Nigeria on introducing this vaccine, which will protect generations of Nigerian children. 
ENTJ|Tony, you were an amazing public servant long before COVID-19 struck – and now you are a hero to millions of people, including me. 
ENTJ|Years ago, the idea of using mosquitoes as an ally in the fight against diseases sounded crazy. But as @ScottLOneill of @WMPglobal explains, this innovative solution has already saved lives around the world. 
ENTJ|I’m at my happiest when I’m learning – no matter how gross the subject matter. Today, I experienced the Meguro Parasitological Museum in Tokyo, and saw what is believed to be the world’s longest tapeworm. 10/10 would visit again. 
ENTJ|I am honored to receive this award. Thank you, Foreign Minister Hayashi.
ENTJ|@KatsunobuKato1 @hfajp @polipolivote Thank you for the great conversation about health and development. I appreciate your leadership and I’m impressed by the passion these young leaders have for global health. Arigatou gozaimasu.
ENTJ|Thank you to the global health champions in Japan for your commitment to saving lives around the world. We must keep up the fight to make sure preventable emergencies never again derail our common pursuit of a better future. 
ENTJ|Inside a two-story brick building in Medellín, Colombia, scientists work long hours in muggy labs breeding millions and millions of mosquitoes 
ENTJ|I’m excited that Dr. Helene Gayle and Ashish Dhawan have decided to join the @gatesfoundation’s board They have been great partners to the foundation over the years—and in Helene’s case, a fantastic leader there. I’m looking forward to working with them. 
ENTJ|Thank you, President Yoon, for your leadership in global health. I look forward to our continued partnership to reduce the burden of disease. 
ENTJ|Its here 
ENTJ|As India celebrates its 75th Independence Day, I congratulate @narendramodi for prioritizing healthcare and digital transformation while spearheading India’s development. Indias progress in these sectors is inspiring and we are fortunate to partner in this journey #AmritMahotsav
ENTJ|While our fight against climate change is far from over, I’m more optimistic than ever that by working together, we can make a net-zero future of abundant, affordable, and clean energy a reality to people everywhere.
ENTJ|This $369 billion investment will spark innovation, drive job creation, and reduce energy prices and emissions. It sets a clear example of what serious climate action looks like.
ENTJ|The Inflation Reduction Act’s passage through Congress is nothing short of extraordinary. The United States is taking a historic step towards the clean energy economy we need to meet our climate goals.
ENTJ|In the past decade, @OERProject has reached more than 1 million students and 20,000 teachers around the world. Here’s a look at the team’s new three-week course on climate 
ENTJ|Prime Minister Shinzo Abe understood that improving health is not only the right thing to do, it also makes the world safer and more prosperous. 
ENTJ|Wow, I’m blown away by your support.
ENTJ|Outbreaks are inevitable, but pandemics are optional. – @larrybrilliant This @OERProject video gives you a glimpse of how Big History is helping students connect the present to the past 
ENTJ|If you want to help teachers and students in the U.S., it’s hard to do better than giving through @DonorsChoose — and you won’t find a better time to do it than now. I’m giving a 50% boost for every donation to DonorsChoose today. 
ENTJ|Teachers deserve our thanks – and support. I’m partnering with @DonorsChoose and boosting all donations today by 50% to help students get back to learning! 
ENTJ|News that polio has been detected in New York wastewater samples is an urgent reminder until we #EndPolio for good, it remains a threat to us all. The global eradication strategy must be fully supported to protect people everywhere. 
ENTJ|Solving climate change is the hardest challenge humanity has ever faced but this would be a historic step forward. It represents our best chance to build an energy future in America that is cleaner, cheaper, and more secure. Let’s get it done. 
ENTJ|Ive long admired his courage to ask tough questions and answer them in a way that is direct and entertaining. John’s new project, working to support maternal health, is worth checking out. 
ENTJ|I never thought of fighting poverty and disease as decreasing world suck and increasing awesome, but during our trip to Africa, @johngreen convinced me that it’s as good a description as any other. 
ENTJ|We cannot look away from the impact climate change is already having on the most vulnerable. 
ENTJ|Jerad taught me how to make my own deerskin medicine bag while he explained the deeper meaning behind a Native tradition that goes back thousands of years. 
ENTJ|Jerad Koepp is the first Native educator to receive the Washington State Teacher of the Year award. I hope you’re as inspired by his work as I am. 
ENTJ|There’s never been a more important time to support teachers. @OERProjects goal is to empower them with free innovative curriculum and teaching tools 
ENTJ|I’m inspired by Jerad’s commitment to helping Native students embrace their culture and make the most of their talents. #backtoschool 
ENTJ|Win or lose, I can’t think of a better way to spend a summer day than as a Pickler. 
ENTJ|Spending time with my best friend Warren never gets old. I’d flip Blizzards with you any day. 
ENTJ|During #AIDS2022, were celebrating @GlobalFund partnerships that have helped cut AIDS-related deaths by 65%. But the fight isn’t over. Investing in the Global Fund can help save 20 million more lives by 2026 and help prevent the next pandemic. 
ENTJ|Were announcing the second phase of @TheADDF’s diagnostics accelerator. I’m hopeful that this new phase will make advances that help change the course of Alzheimer’s. 
ENTJ|Now, we need Congress to act quickly. I’m optimistic the U.S. can deliver on a clean energy future, but there’s no time to waste.
ENTJ|Really excited to see Senators Schumer and Manchin come together in what could be a historic step forward for the climate.
ENTJ|.@BenJohnspb any tips for my form?
ENTJ|Fifty years ago, I started playing this little-known sport with a funny name. Now it’s all the rage. 
ENTJ|Hey @Discovery, sharks are cool, but mosquitoes are deadly. Did you know mosquitoes kill more people in one day than sharks kill in 100 years?
ENTJ|From Malawi to the United States, new cases of polio are a reminder that until we #EndPolio for good, it remains a threat to all of us. 
ENTJ|This is heartbreaking. The world had made so much progress before COVID. There’s a lot of work ahead to get back to, and eventually exceed, pre-pandemic vaccination levels. 
ENTJ|Congratulations @narendramodi for yet another milestone of administering #200crorevaccinations. We are grateful for our continued partnership with Indian vaccine manufacturers and the Indian government for mitigating the impact of COVID19. 
ENTJ|Mr. Mandela exemplified how we can fight for progress, diminish stigmas, and spread hope. He played a crucial role in the progress we have made so far against HIV/AIDs. I will never forget the example that he set.
ENTJ|This is one of my favorite photos ever. My dad, Mr. Mandela, and President Jimmy Carter hold infants born with HIV to dismiss the fear and stigma around touching people who live with the disease. 
ENTJ|Nelson Mandelas legacy lives on as a reminder that it’s possible to solve big challenges. I admired President Mandela for his courage to stand against apartheid and I came to know him personally for the fight against HIV/AIDs. 
ENTJ|Who better to recruit the next generation of clean tech innovators than Iron Man? 
ENTJ|If we had stopped the COVID pandemic in less than 100 days, we could’ve saved over 98% of the lives lost. Here’s how we can prevent it from happening again 
ENTJ|I have an obligation to return my resources to society in ways that have the greatest impact for reducing suffering and improving lives. And I hope others in positions of great wealth and privilege will step up in this moment too.
ENTJ|As I look to the future, I plan to give virtually all of my wealth to the foundation. I will move down and eventually off of the list of the world’s richest people.
ENTJ|Although the foundation bears our names, basically half our resources have come from Warren Buffett. His incredible generosity is a huge reason why the foundation has been able to be so ambitious. I can never adequately express how much I appreciate his friendship and guidance. 
ENTJ|I am very proud of the foundation’s role in helping solve big problems like preventing pandemics, reducing childhood deaths, eradicating diseases, improving food security and climate adaptation, achieving gender equality, and improving educational outcomes. 
ENTJ|With the support and guidance of our board, we plan to increase our spending from nearly $6 billion per year today to $9 billion per year by 2026. To help make this spending increase possible, I am transferring $20 billion to the foundation’s endowment this month. 
ENTJ|Melinda and I started the @gatesfoundation in 2000 because we believed that every person should have the chance to live a healthy and productive life. That vision remains the same, but the great crises of our time require all of us to do more. 
ENTJ|But I’m still optimistic. These setbacks are happening in the context of two decades’ worth of historic progress and I believe it is possible to mitigate the damage and get back to the progress the world was making.
ENTJ|The pandemic is one of the biggest setbacks in history. The war on Ukraine is a gigantic tragedy for the entire world. The damage from climate change is already worse than most models predicted. The U.S. has taken a huge step backwards for gender equality and women’s health.
ENTJ|Several huge global setbacks over the past few years have left many people discouraged and wondering whether the world is destined to get worse.
ENTJ|When I was 13, computer science changed the course of my life. I was really lucky to have access to a computer that early on. I hope this initiative will give every student the same opportunity.
ENTJ|Fusion will need to be an important part of our zero-emissions future. That’s why the work that @energyzap does is so exciting. 
ENTJ|If you’re a big tennis fan like I am, @devisridhar’s profile on Althea Gibson is a grand slam. She was the first Black player to win Wimbledon. 
ENTJ|Prime Minister Abe was a friend and partner of our foundation who helped save lives around the world by championing universal health coverage and programs like the Global Fund. I’m shocked and saddened by his death.
ENTJ|Happy 10th birthday to CRISPR, one of the most important inventions in medicine, biology, and agriculture. 
ENTJ|.@amortowles is one of my favorite storytellers. I was wowed by his writing in The Lincoln Highway. 
ENTJ|It’s also a reminder that it’s not just about having enough vaccines or therapeutics. It’s about figuring out how to help countries deploy them. @ashishkjha 
ENTJ|I got to join the @Breakthrough team to talk about the incredible work they’re doing to accelerate climate innovation. I’m lucky to work with such smart and dedicated individuals. 
ENTJ|Today’s ruling makes it more challenging for the US to hit its climate goals. It’s now more important than ever for Congress to level the playing field for clean technologies.
ENTJ|Being in New York is always fun – you never know who you’ll run into. It was great meeting you and Namrata!
ENTJ|Here’s progress worth celebrating. More people have bank accounts than ever before 
ENTJ|It’s great to see countries and partners jointly sign the Kigali Declaration. It wouldnt have been possible without Kigali Summit hosts @RwandaGov, @CombatNTDs , @endmalaria, @WHO facilitators , key donors like President @mohamedbinzayed whose commitment help advance the fight.
ENTJ|1.7 billion people are affected by debilitating Neglected Tropical Diseases. Thankfully, an extraordinary public private partnership, and the donation of over 14 billion drugs, has meant that were a step closer to a future where NTDs are #NeglectedNoMore. 
ENTJ|You can find the answer here. 
ENTJ|How many tons of hydrogen does the world use each year?
ENTJ|If you want to understand what’s going on with politics in the United States, Why We’re Polarized by @ezraklein is the book to pick up. 
ENTJ|This is a sad day. Reversing Roe v. Wade is an unjust and unacceptable setback. And it puts women’s lives at risk, especially the most disadvantaged.
ENTJ|Through renewed investments in malaria and NTDs, we can help end these endemic diseases, and prevent future pandemics.
ENTJ|Daniel Boakye of @TheENDFund has spent 45 years working on solutions for neglected tropical diseases, including river blindness. As he says, We have the tools we need. The priority now is to deploy them in the right way to get to elimination. 
ENTJ|When most people think about what produces greenhouse gas emissions, they think about cars and electricity. But they add up to only about one third of the total. Clean hydrogen could help eliminate the rest 
ENTJ|The Power by @NaomiAllthenews raises timely questions about the way people are connected by gender, family, community, and country. 
ENTJ|Important guidance from @TheADDF founder @ahfillit outlining the path forward on Alzheimer’s ▪️ More – and better – biomarkers ▪️ Exploratory trials ▪️ Repurposed drugs 
ENTJ|My advice is simple read a lot and discover a skill you enjoy. For some, that means being great at science or a great communicator. There’s so much opportunity to do good in the world.
ENTJ|I was recently asked what advice I would give to young people who want to make a positive impact on the world.
ENTJ|What a great meeting with WA’s teacher of the year, Jared Koepp. He taught me a lot about the challenges that Native students face. 
ENTJ|I guess we finally ran out of microchips.
ENTJ|Yesterday, I had a chance to spend the day focusing on climate – and the innovations that can prevent the very worst effects of climate change. 
ENTJ|@jaramillogroup Very cool to hear about all your exciting research. Thanks for letting me be a jaramigo for the day!
ENTJ|@TheChemEngineer @gatesfoundation It was great to meet you yesterday!
ENTJ|I’m grateful for Warren’s gifts to support the foundation’s work and for our many years of friendship. When he decided in 2006 to make these gifts, it moved me to tears. It still does.
ENTJ|The fact is, we’ve never been closer to ending polio. The huge progress Pakistan has made in the fight against polio is a reminder for why the world cannot lose sight of this goal. 
ENTJ|It really is mind-blowing how quickly safe, effective COVID-19 vaccines were made 
ENTJ|The world has an opportunity to end polio in the next five years so that no child will have to suffer as I do from a disease that is entirely preventable. @mindadentler 
ENTJ|Multiple people told me to read The Ministry for the Future by Kim Stanley Robinson and I’m glad I listened – it’s terrific. Robinson presents a stimulating story on climate change, spanning decades and continents. Its packed with fascinating ideas 
ENTJ|I’ve been a fan of @amortowles for a few years now and his recent novel The Lincoln Highway is fantastic. Set in 1954, he uses the story of two brothers to show that our personal journeys are never as linear or predictable as we might hope 
ENTJ|.@ezrakleins Why We’re Polarized is a fascinating look at human psychology. He argues that the increasing polarization in America stems from identity—the human instinct to let our group identities guide our decision-making 
ENTJ|I’m glad that I followed @jenngates1996’s recommendation for The Power by @NaomiAllthenews. I gained a more visceral sense of the abuse and injustice women experience today. The people who tackle these issues around the world are truly heroes 
ENTJ|I recently published a list of books you might want to read this summer. Each of the writers took a meaty subject and made it compelling without sacrificing any complexity 
ENTJ|It’s amazing how much I learn from reading @TheEconomist. Here’s a fascinating article on new brain charts that could help doctors diagnose Alzheimer’s earlier. 
ENTJ|Thank you @SenatorDurbin for the productive conversation on preparing for and preventing the next pandemic.
ENTJ|What if you could visit a museum exhibit about the last pandemic the world ever faced – COVID-19 – fifty years in the future? 
ENTJ|.@mgraceandrews of @ProjectVesta is using the natural mineral olivine and oceans to remove a trillion tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. #WorldOceansDay 
ENTJ|No matter where I am, I always have a stack of books close by. Here are five that stuck with me. 
ENTJ|These heroes are doing incredible work. 
ENTJ|The innovators at @Ecocem have already reduced CO2 emissions in Europe by over 14 million tons. 
ENTJ|The brilliant team behind the @Oceanbird could reduce carbon emissions in the sailing industry by up to 90% using clean wind power technology. 
ENTJ|As Head of Operations of @CFSenergy, @RocketJoy is working to harness the same energy source that powers the stars to create clean energy here on Earth. 
ENTJ|Geochemist @mgraceandrews of @Vestas is exploring how the mineral olivine can be spread across oceans to remove a trillion tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. 
ENTJ|Meet some of the brilliant people behind the breakthroughs that could help the world get to net-zero carbon emissions.
ENTJ|Kim (@DaalenKim) was nominated for her outstanding research and her wider activism for global health. Just look at how much she’s accomplished so far. 
ENTJ|Cynthia (@cyncoso) is an outstanding scientist, researcher, teacher, and leader. She supports hundreds of students through the African Society of Cambridge University and co-founded @africansinstem.
ENTJ|Reetika’s research explores gender violence and the climate crisis – lifting up the experiences of Dalit and Adivasi girls. Here’s a look at @reetiks’s award-winning comic book. 
ENTJ|Even though my dad is no longer with us, his wisdom and generosity lives on through the work of @GatesCambridge scholars. This year, 3 exceptional scholars received the Bill Gates Sr. Prize for outstanding research and leadership. 
ENTJ|Earlier this year, I made my first trip ever to Pakistan to learn more about the country’s incredible efforts to wipe out polio 
ENTJ|It was great to catch up with @PCMag 40 years after our first interview.
ENTJ|How its going 
ENTJ|How it started 
ENTJ|The greatest medical breakthrough of this pandemic is the creation of COVID-19 vaccines that use mRNA. Here are 4 steps to develop, manufacture, and distribute vaccines even faster next time. 
ENTJ|To meet the world’s climate goals, clean energy technology needs to be affordable, attractive, and accessible to all.
ENTJ|Just like we have a robust system to prevent and extinguish fires, there needs to be an equally effective system to identify and respond to disease outbreaks. This firefighting comparison is a useful way to understand the amazing work of @sofoniaskt 
ENTJ|I can’t believe this was 15 years ago. I always enjoyed the @allthingsd conference.
ENTJ|@waltmossberg @Kodak Reconnecting with Steve was fantastic. And for the record, I wasn’t reluctant to take the photo. But I do wish I had an opportunity to run a comb through my hair first.
ENTJ|Incredible. @lionheart1759 
ENTJ|While there are many great commencement speeches, I found this one from my friend Reid particularly insightful.
ENTJ|@mansukhmandviya It was great to meet Dr @mansukhmandviya and exchange perspectives on global health. Indias success with the vaccination drive and the use of technology to drive health outcomes at scale offers many lessons for the world.
ENTJ|Happy to meet Prime Minister @sanchezcastejon and members of his government today in Madrid. Great to see his leadership and commitment to addressing some of the most pressing global challenges, particularly more equity in global health, climate change and food security.
ENTJ|The school shooting in Texas is heartbreaking. No parent should worry that their child isn’t safe at school. We must come together and act now so this never happens again.
ENTJ|Not long ago, the world increased aid for global health during a time of crisis. We must do so again. 
ENTJ|Movies like Outbreak nailed it when they imagined a global disease-fighting team who is ready to respond to a crisis on a moment’s notice. Now we need to make it a reality. 
ENTJ|Ruth’s discovery of rotavirus saved millions of lives. And learning about rota is what inspired us to launch @GatesFoundation. Ruth was a real hero.
ENTJ|I had a great time answering questions on @Reddit yesterday about pandemic prevention, climate change, farmland, my cell phone, and much more. Here are some highlights. 
ENTJ|I’m answering your questions now on @Reddit 
ENTJ|Hey, @Reddit, it’s been a while. Ask me anything at 1030AM Pacific Time.
ENTJ|I hope the spirit of Paul Farmer’s work lives on for generations. 
ENTJ|I have appreciated our conversations over the years and your perspective about the importance of staying prepared.
ENTJ|It was an honor to speak (virtually) at the #GlobalCOVIDSummit today about the urgent action needed to end this pandemic and prevent the next. Im grateful for the leadership from the US, Belize, Germany, Indonesia and Senegal. 
ENTJ|Bono, you’re just as amazing a philanthropist as you are a friend. Working and learning together has been one of my greatest joys. 
ENTJ|I cant wait to read this.
ENTJ|We will continue working with partners and do all we can to ensure none of us have to deal with a pandemic again.
ENTJ|The Gates Foundation is coming together today for the first time in two years, and I am lucky to be on Teams to see everyone and thank them for their hard work.
ENTJ|Im fortunate to be vaccinated and boosted and have access to testing and great medical care.
ENTJ|Ive tested positive for COVID. Im experiencing mild symptoms and am following the experts advice by isolating until Im healthy again.
ENTJ|World-changing ideas require bold thinkers and doers to transform them into reality. These new Advisory Group members for the @gatesfoundation’s Goalkeepers initiative are changing the world. 
ENTJ|Katalin Kariko (@kkariko) saw the potential of mRNA to save lives when few others did–and she was willing to fight tooth and nail to pursue it 
ENTJ|Thank you for having me, @EmmanuelMacron, and for your commitment to tackling some of the worlds toughest challenges, like climate change and better health everywhere in the world. I’m excited to continue working towards a future without pandemics.
ENTJ|John’s leadership at @AfricaCDC has been remarkable – especially during the last two years. @PEPFAR’s work has saved tens of millions of lives, and there are many reasons to be hopeful about HIV prevention and treatment in the future.
ENTJ|If we’re going to prevent the next pandemic, the world needs the infectious disease equivalent of firefighters. Also in this video a cute puppy. 
ENTJ|@ShereenBhan @CNBCTV18Live Thanks for having me!
ENTJ|This is amazing, John and Ann. It’s great to see you supporting the next generation of innovators—the people we’re all counting on to make clean-energy breakthroughs.
ENTJ|I also had a chance to meet up with Gates Foundation Goalkeepers @DanielleAlakija, @abcholmes, @seyiakiwowo, @ThokoPooley, @je1bc, and Our World in Datas @MaxCRoser. 
ENTJ|What a day! I had a great time in London chatting with @amolrajan, @DrWaheedArian, and Professor Dame Sarah Gilbert about my new book. 
ENTJ|Thanks, @TrevorNoah for the thoughtful conversation. I always appreciate your smart questions (and smarter jokes) about these really important issues.
ENTJ|If we’re going to make COVID-19 the last pandemic, we need the GERM team 
ENTJ|My new book, How to Prevent the Next Pandemic, is available now. Proceeds will be donated to Partners in Health in memory of Dr. Paul Farmer, who inspired the world with his commitment to saving lives 
ENTJ|I was shocked to wake up to the news this morning. A reversal of Roe v. Wade would set us back 50 years and disproportionately impact the most vulnerable women in society. I support a womans right to make their own decisions about their health care.
ENTJ|My new book comes out tomorrow – but @GatesNotes Insiders can get an early sneak peek and download a free chapter now 
ENTJ|No one wants to live through this again – and we don’t have to. As @larrybrilliant says Outbreaks are inevitable, but pandemics are optional. 
ENTJ|I’ve been lucky to spend time with, and learn from, many extraordinary teachers over the years, like these incredible Washington State teachers. I appreciate their dedication and resilience. #TeacherAppreciationWeek 
ENTJ|The world can make COVID-19 the last pandemic 
ENTJ|The world wasn’t ready for COVID, but we can choose to be ready next time. 
ENTJ|I’m excited to chat with one of my favorite thinkers @FareedZakaria next week at @92Y! 
ENTJ|To avoid another COVID-19 – or worse – the world needs a full-time, paid team whose entire job is to prevent pandemics. I call it GERM 
ENTJ|I’m looking forward to this chat with @amolrajan at @howtoacademy and @penguinlive.
ENTJ|The best way to prevent pneumonia is to vaccinate children against the pathogens that cause it. This is an impressive effort. #LongLifeForAll @MoHFWINDIA 
ENTJ|Giving a TED talk is always a memorable (and nerve-wracking!) experience. Beyond the talk, I also got to listen to the stories of frontline workers and catch up with some of the people working to make the world a more equitable place 
ENTJ|The Global Fund is one of the kindest things people have ever done for one another. Replenishing it will lower malaria cases by almost two thirds in just four years, strengthen health systems, and help ensure COVID-19 is the last pandemic. #WorldMalariaDay
ENTJ|Happy World Book Day! I try to read every day, whether I have a busy day at the office or am out for a hike. It’s one of my favorite ways to learn new things and better understand the world. 
ENTJ|Seven years ago, I gave a TED Talk about how the world wasn’t ready for the next epidemic. A lot has changed since then 
ENTJ|We can’t reach zero carbon emissions without innovation. In this new series, you’ll meet some people who are on the cutting edge of clean energy #EarthDay 
ENTJ|Interesting article on how Liberia’s health workers use data to provide crucial insights and stop diseases from spreading 
ENTJ|I hope Namzi is feeling better. Her comics are great!
ENTJ|One of the surprises of the pandemic is how long it took to develop effective treatments—few people thought there would be vaccines before COVID medicines. In this first excerpt from my new book I suggest ways to speed things up during future outbreaks. 
ENTJ|This rocks. 
ENTJ|One of the best parts of my job is learning from innovators and entrepreneurs taking on some of the worlds greatest challenges. They make me optimistic about the world’s ability to get to net-zero carbon emissions 
ENTJ|Preventing the next pandemic is not cheap, but itll save lives and money in the long run. The IMF estimates that COVID will cost nearly $14 trillion. We can save trillions by spending billions.
ENTJ|This week, I got to do what every nerd dreams of – talk about ideas and learn from others doing big things. I believe that with good ideas and collaboration, we can make COVID the last pandemic. Plus, it’s not every day you can say thanks for coming to my TED Talk. 
ENTJ|Im excited to take the stage at #TED2022 and share a plan to make COVID-19 the last pandemic. 
ENTJ|Solving for Zero is an excellent overview of the complex challenge of climate change and an inspiring look at some of the most promising solutions. I’m glad I got to be a part of it and encourage you to take a look 
ENTJ|The latest #ClimateReport is an important reminder of the work ahead. I’m especially encouraged by the focus on the breakthroughs we need to avoid a climate disaster. (The word innovation appears 4,989 times!) 
ENTJ|No one was a better or more tireless advocate for improving global health than Paul.
ENTJ|Bed nets might be simple tools, but they’re one of the best weapons against malaria. 
ENTJ|Bono is humanity’s rock star and I’m fortunate to call him my friend. Congratulations on this well-deserved recognition.
ENTJ|Wild polio virus returning to Malawi reminds us that strong health systems are critical for ending disease, stopping re-emergence of diseases we thought were gone, and preventing new diseases from spreading 
ENTJ|Young people are right – it’s not too late to avoid a climate disaster 
ENTJ|What a lovely bake, Ruby. You deserve a Paul Hollywood handshake for that one!
ENTJ|I have enough nostalgia to go around. John Roach was a true pioneer of the industry, and I’m grateful to have known him.
ENTJ|Changing mindsets is never easy, but Sudha Varghese empowers girls to believe in themselves and see their potential for greatness 
ENTJ|In February 2020, we had a degree of optimism that the world was better prepared to respond to COVID-19. Two years later, we gathered to discuss lessons learned that might help us prevent the next pandemic. 
ENTJ|A world without tuberculosis is attainable if we deliver effective diagnostics , treatment to all who need it. Fully funding The Global Fund will get us on track to end TB and save 20 million more lives.
ENTJ|Every day I’m reminded of how my dad’s wisdom, generosity, and compassion lives on in the many people he influenced and inspired around the world 
ENTJ|Sudha Varghese runs a school in Bihar, India that teaches students how to stand up for themselves and see their own potential for greatness. 
ENTJ|Shumaila Rehamani is a polio vaccinator in Pakistan. She talks with families and community leaders to answer all their questions about the importance of vaccination. She makes sure every child in her community is protected from this disease. 
ENTJ|Mamello Makhele is a nurse-midwife working to improve health care for women in rural Lesotho, where there are high rates of maternal mortality. Thanks to her incredible work, many women are healthier today in Lesotho. 
ENTJ|Brooke Brown, the 2021 Washington State Teacher of the Year, helps high school seniors explore their identity. She is a phenomenal teacher and was kind enough to show me one of her favorite lessons to teach. 
ENTJ|Kakenya Ntaiya founded @KakenyasDream to enable girls’ education and end harmful traditional practices like child marriage. Her story is a powerful example of how one person’s act of bravery can spark dramatic change. 
ENTJ|Ive been lucky to meet and learn from so many changemakers. These incredible women continue to inspire me. ⬇️
ENTJ|One of the most significant ways my dad’s spirit continues is through the @GatesCambridge Scholarship. Of all the grants he was involved in at our foundation, this one was always his favorite. 
ENTJ|By acting now and funding organizations like @CEPIvaccines, we can help ensure the world never again experiences the hardship of a pandemic. I’m encouraged by the new commitments to groundbreaking R,D made at the Global Pandemic Preparedness Summit.
ENTJ|In a crisis, we can always look for the helpers—the people who are putting their lives on the line to aid refugees and victims of the invasion—and support them. I’m proud to support the UN’s refugee agency and urge the global community to do the same. 
ENTJ|It’s gut-wrenching to see the people of Ukraine suffering so much. The world feels especially heavy right now, with each day bringing news of families torn apart in Afghanistan, Ukraine, and so many other places.
ENTJ|I’m optimistic about our ability to prevent the next pandemic. We have learned so much from COVID, and the innovations have been tremendous. 
ENTJ|The Global Fund is one of the best investments in global health. Fully funding its programs for the next 3 years is critical to ending HIV, TB, and malaria while helping ensure COVID-19 is the last pandemic.
ENTJ|At the end of the day, Paul’s most lasting impact can be found in the patients he loved so dearly—all of the people who are alive today because he dedicated his life to helping them. 
ENTJ|His work will continue through Partners in Health, the incredible organization he co-founded. It is a phenomenal legacy.
ENTJ|Paul was never happier than when he was caring for patients in one of the clinics he helped create. My heart goes out to his family and friends, his colleagues, and all the people whose lives he touched.
ENTJ|What a devastating loss. Paul is a hero, and I was fortunate to call him a friend. I have never known anyone who was more passionate about reducing the world’s worst inequities in health—or who did more to live by his values.
ENTJ|It has been over a year since wild polio paralyzed a child in Pakistan, presenting an incredible opportunity to stop this disease for good. I traveled to Pakistan to learn from their polio program leaders. 
ENTJ|Thank you @ImranKhanPTI for the productive discussions on the steps being taken in Pakistan to eliminate polio. I’m encouraged by the country’s commitment to eradication and am optimistic that if everyone remains vigilant, we can #endpolio. 
ENTJ|I’m hopeful that the world can come together to end this pandemic and prevent the next one. Thanks Dax Shepard, Monica Padman, and @davidfarrier for the great conversation. 
ENTJ|I’m more optimistic than ever that we can one day stop Alzheimer’s because of research like this. 
ENTJ|I believe that COVID-19 can be the last pandemic. ‘How to Prevent the Next Pandemic’ will explain why. 
ENTJ|Science fiction can help expand our understanding by pushing the limits of what is possible. 
ENTJ|The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation @IHMEUW found that improving trust could make a critical difference when it comes to ending this pandemic and preventing the next one. 
ENTJ|Significant climate progress is possible in 2022 if we commit to bold action. With the support of our growing community of @Breakthrough Energy partners, we can accelerate the commercialization of the critical climate technologies we need to spark the green industrial revolution.
ENTJ|The London Declaration on NTDs helped dozens of countries eliminate diseases , reach hundreds of millions more people with treatments. On #WorldNTDDay I welcome the Kigali Declaration to build on this success through strong country leadership.
ENTJ|Strengthening health systems is critical to preventing future pandemics. @exemplarshealth shows how countries like Senegal and India are building resilient health infrastructures. 
ENTJ|We’ve built an incredible organization in the @gatesfoundation over two decades and I’m excited about the next chapter in our history. Our new board members will help us build a world where every person has an opportunity to lead a healthy, productive life 
ENTJ|Kakenya Ntaiya bravely defied local traditions to make a different plan for her future and her community. In a society where young girls’ lives are often decided for them, she founded @KakenyasDream to educate girls and end practices like child marriage 
ENTJ|One person’s act of bravery can spark dramatic change in hundreds of lives. @KakenyaN’s story is a powerful example. 
ENTJ|This is an important reminder from @rajpanjabi. The world should not have to choose between saving lives from COVID-19 and saving lives from malaria. It’s possible to do both.
ENTJ|I wholeheartedly agree with Larrys view that all companies need to be actively preparing for their net zero transition - shareholders, employees, customers, communities, and regulators expect it.
ENTJ|European Commissioner @SKyriakidesEU and I discussed the importance of multilateral partnerships like @CEPIvaccines in ending this pandemic and preventing another. 
ENTJ|To have any hope of reaching net zero and halting the progress of climate change, we need deep and comprehensive collaboration between the public and private sectors worldwide. I was encouraged by today’s discussions about how to accelerate innovation. 
ENTJ|The omicron surge is an unfortunate reminder that the only way to eliminate the threat of COVID-19 somewhere is to eliminate it everywhere. That’s why @gatesfoundation is joining @wellcometrust to renew our investment in @CEPIvaccines. 
ENTJ|Genomic sequencing is a critical tool that will help us fight COVID-19 and prevent the next pandemic. 
ENTJ|The fight to eradicate HIV is far from over, but incredible progress has been made through scientific innovation, activism, and collective global action. These lessons provide a path forward with COVID-19 and hope for preventing the next pandemic. 
ENTJ|ICYMI here’s a recap of my conversation with @devisridhar. We chatted about this pandemic, how to prevent the next one, and a few things in between. 
ENTJ|Thanks @devisridhar for taking the time today to discuss omicron, vaccines, and how the world can come together to prevent the next pandemic.
ENTJ|@devisridhar @gavi @WHO @CDCgov @trvrb .@DrTedros has started the conversation about how we avoid the next pandemic which is important. I appreciate your work on this. We can do a lot better next time!!#
ENTJ|@devisridhar @gavi @WHO @CDCgov A more transmissive variant is not likely but we have been surprised a lot during this pandemic. Omicron will create a lot of immunity at least for the next year. @trvrb tracks the genetics really well. We may have to take yearly shots for Covid for some time.
ENTJ|@devisridhar @gavi @WHO @CDCgov As countries experience their Omicron wave health systems will be challenged. Most of the severe cases will be unvaccinated people. Once Omicron goes through a country then the rest of the year should see far fewer cases so Covid can be treated more like seasonal flu.
ENTJ|@devisridhar @gavi @WHO @CDCgov The data is pretty strong that it came from another species which is true for most pandemics. People will continue to speculate on this and we should make sure labs are careful. There will be future outbreaks coming from other species so we need to invest in being ready. #
ENTJ|@devisridhar @gavi @WHO @CDCgov From 2000 to the start of the pandemic we made strong progress on health and other goals. The pandemic is a huge setback - including rich countries not focusing on the needs of developing countries as much. I hope we can reverse that.
ENTJ|@devisridhar @gavi @WHO @CDCgov People like you and I and Tony Fauci have been subject to a lot of misinformation. I didnt expect that. Some of it like me putting chips in arms doesnt make sense to me - why would I want to do that?#
ENTJ|@devisridhar @gavi Trusted authorities like @WHO and @CDCgov need more resources to see the pandemic early (surveillance) and to communicate better. Social media got behind on trying to get factual information out - there will be a lot of debate about how to do better on that
ENTJ|@devisridhar @gavi Do you think the world will come together to get ready for the next one? I hope so but I am not sure.#
ENTJ|@devisridhar @gavi Also some countries did a better job of reducing mobility, using masks and protecting the elderly. We werent prepared - no practice in advance.#
ENTJ|@devisridhar @gavi A few countries like Australia moved fast to diagnose cases at scale and isolate people who were infected. They were able to limit deaths dramatically. Once the numbers get large in a country it is too late. So the first few months made a lot of difference.
ENTJ|@devisridhar When we have adequate supply then tiered pricing is used where the rich countries pay a lot more than middle income and low income pay the least which is funded by @gavi. When supply is limited rich countries have to not outbid the others so governments are key to this. #
ENTJ|@devisridhar mRna vaccines still cant meet all the demand so figuring out who gets what is complicated.#
ENTJ|@devisridhar During 2021 the supply of vaccines was limited and they mostly went to wealthy countries. Now we have a lot of supply overall and the problems are logistics and demand. The health systems in developing countries are a limiting factor.
ENTJ|@devisridhar The vaccines we have prevent severe disease and death very well but they are missing two key things. First they still allow infections (breakthrough) and the duration appears to be limited. We need vaccines that prevent re-infection and have many years of duration.#
ENTJ|Im excited to talk with @DeviSridhar today about her work at the University of Edinburgh Medical School and @GlobalHealthGP, and to answer some of your questions about what we’ve been learning recently about the pandemic. #
ENTJ|Through my foundation work Im very lucky to have the opportunity to talk to—and learn from—experts in many different fields. Many of my conversations recently have been about the omicron variant and how to prevent the next pandemic.
ENTJ|Understanding how the connections in our brains give rise to consciousness and our ability to learn may help lead to great breakthroughs in the way we solve the world’s hardest problems. This is one of the most fascinating books I read this year. 
ENTJ|We have some, but not all, of the tools we need to hit our target of limiting global warming to less than 2 degrees. We need to prioritize closing that gap if we’re going to avoid a climate disaster 
ENTJ|The world has lost a hero. Archbishop Desmond Tutu led with his values, empathy and optimism. He put everyone he met at ease with his incredible laugh and energy. He inspired me with his sense of purpose to build peace out of the struggle of oppression. I will miss him greatly.
ENTJ|One of my favorite holiday traditions is sharing books with family and friends. Here are 5 books I loved reading this year 
ENTJ|Mamello Makhele is a hero from Lesotho who traveled by foot and donkey to bring health services to women in need during the pandemic. Her story is nothing short of inspiring 
ENTJ|I know it’s frustrating to go into another holiday season with COVID looming over us. But it won’t be like this forever. Someday the pandemic will end, and the better we look after each other, the sooner that time will come.
ENTJ|If there’s good news here, it’s that omicron moves so quickly that once it becomes dominant in a country, the wave there should last less than 3 months. Those few months could be bad, but I still believe if we take the right steps, the pandemic can be over in 2022.
ENTJ|There will be more breakthrough cases in people who are vx’d, which sounds concerning but is purely a factor of how many people are vx’d and how fast this variant is spreading. Vaccines are designed to prevent people from getting seriously ill or dying , are doing that well.
ENTJ|In the meantime, we all have to look out for each other, especially the most vulnerable, whether they live down the street or in another country. That means wearing masks, avoiding big indoor gatherings, and getting vaccinated. Getting a booster gives the best protection.
ENTJ|The big unknown is how sick omicron makes you. We need to take it seriously until we know more about it. Even if it’s only half as severe as delta, it will be the worst surge we have seen so far because it’s so infectious.
ENTJ|Omicron is spreading faster than any virus in history. It will soon be in every country in the world.
ENTJ|Just when it seemed like life would return to normal, we could be entering the worst part of the pandemic. Omicron will hit home for all of us. Close friends of mine now have it, and I’ve canceled most of my holiday plans.
ENTJ|In Tanzania, health workers and community members are serving as disease detectives with a new app called Afyadata 
ENTJ|I spoke to Prime Minister @Kishida230 about his new global health strategy and Japan’s commitment to the world’s poorest people. I’m encouraged to see this pledge and Japan’s recent leadership of the @WBGIDA and Nutrition for Growth summits. 
ENTJ|The Omicron variant is concerning, but the world is better prepared to tackle potentially bad variants than at any other point in the pandemic. Here’s why I’m still hopeful the end of the COVID-19 pandemic is finally in sight 
ENTJ|Great to meet with @MohamedbinZayed again to recognize Niger’s progress in the fight against neglected tropical diseases. His commitment to this fight, to polio eradication and to disease elimination at large will help save millions of lives.
ENTJ|This order signed by President Biden signals a strong commitment to deploying the solutions we need to get to net-zero and avoid a climate disaster. 
ENTJ|2021 was an incredibly hard year for many people, including me, but there are reasons to be optimistic that 2022 will be better 
ENTJ|Better nutrition can lead to shifts in health and productivity—boosting prosperity for families, communities, and economies. At the N4G2021 in Tokyo, I announced our support for @UNICEF’s nutrition fund to ensure tools to combat malnutrition are available to those in need.
ENTJ|2021 has been a year of big transitions for me, but it hasn’t changed why I love the work I do. Here are four things I’m thinking about heading into next year. 
ENTJ|The groundbreaking RTS,S vaccine will help save tens of thousands of children and is paving the way for a new pipeline of tools to #EndMalaria. 
ENTJ|Robots will play a huge part in our future, and fiction like Kazuo Ishiguros Klara and the Sun is a great way to explore what that might mean. 
ENTJ|Accelerating long-duration energy storage innovation can significantly reduce annual CO2 emissions and lay the foundation for a net-zero economy by 2050.
ENTJ|The @gatesfoundation is supporting GIISER which is working to increase the in-country capacity for rapid evaluation of variants on the African continent. This will help us better understand variants of concern and how the current vaccines may perform. 
ENTJ|South Africa did the right thing by reporting these cases. They have invested heavily in R,D including genomic sequencing capabilities which have made it possible to quickly identify variants, like Omicron, and help the world respond appropriately.
ENTJ|Experts like Trevor Bedford have done an excellent job explaining what scientists have learned so far about the new variant of concern known as Omicron. 
ENTJ|I made this video a few months ago to help explain what happens when a virus mutates. You can read more about the ways in which new variants are (and aren’t) complicating the pandemic here 
ENTJ|I usually read a lot of non-fiction books, but lately I’ve found myself drawn back to the kinds of novels I would’ve loved as a kid. These were some of my favorites this year Which do you like better?
ENTJ|There’s lots of speculation about what Shakespeare’s life was really like, but we do know that his son died at age 11. Hamnet shares the story of how grief tore the Shakespeare family apart. 
ENTJ|When I was a kid, I was obsessed with science fiction. But @andyweirauthor’s latest book Project Hail Mary is a fun read even if you aren’t a sci-fi fan. I finished the whole thing in one weekend. 
ENTJ|I read a lot of great books this year. These were some of my favorites. 
ENTJ|It’s hard to believe that it’s been 50 years since the 4004 kickstarted the PC era. I still remember reading about its release with Paul and dreaming about how the worlds first microprocessor might shape the future. 
ENTJ|About 3.6 billion people—nearly half of the world’s population—lack toilets or use unsafe sanitation. This #WorldToiletDay, I’m optimistic this sanitation crisis can be solved. 
ENTJ|2021 saw incredible innovation in health and climate. I am excited about many of these advancements and look forward to seeing what’s next. 
ENTJ|I love the message in @JohnDoerr’s new book that in order to eliminate the Green Premiums, we need to make a scalable plan now 
ENTJ|The bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act is an important step on America’s path to achieving net-zero emissions. But the job is not done. Congress should also pass the Build Back Better Act to help accelerate development of the climate solutions we need.
ENTJ|Data sharing and global collaboration move us closer to new #Alzheimers diagnostics, treatments, and cures. I’m optimistic about what lies ahead 
ENTJ|We still have a lot of work to do, but the conversation I heard at the #COP26 climate summit left me feeling optimistic that we can avoid a climate disaster 
ENTJ|Data on student outcomes can help institutional leaders and policymakers better understand the economic value that colleges deliver to students. This new tool makes that data publicly available—a critical step toward a more equitable higher ed system.
ENTJ|Poverty and the world’s top global health problems are closely connected. By improving one, we can make progress towards fixing the other 
ENTJ|The effects of climate change are affecting many aspects of our lives. By working to minimize its effects, we are also working to improve global health. However, ending malaria needs to (and should) happen faster 
ENTJ|Nobody can be an expert in all things at once. To end malaria—or any disease—leaders from around the world need to collaborate to make sustainable progress 
ENTJ|I recently had the chance to meet 36 incredible graduate students working to #endmalaria. Here are some of my favorite questions they asked.
ENTJ|To tackle the biggest global health challenges, all countries must have access to vaccines and other health innovations. This $150M commitment from the foundation and @sida will help low- and middle-income countries get the essential supplies they need. 
ENTJ|I recently met with 36 remarkable graduate students who made me more optimistic than ever that we can #EndMalaria. 
ENTJ|Many thanks to @YoYoMa for helping us spotlight the Grand Challenges in Global Health - and for this beautiful performance with the @gatesfoundations own Chris Karp. It’s always fun to find out your colleague has a hidden talent. 
ENTJ|Setting concrete goals is a critical first step to solving any problem. I’m impressed by @JohnDoerr’s approach to identifying the objectives and key results needed to track our progress on climate.
ENTJ|COVID-19 will not be the last pandemic threat the world faces. I spoke to the #GrandChallenges community about the ambitious innovation agenda we need to end this crisis and be ready to respond to the next. 
ENTJ|Getting to zero carbon emissions isn’t optional. After #COP26, I am optimistic that we can meet the challenge. 
ENTJ|Demand for syringes has skyrocketed to deliver the COVID-19 vaccines. Increasing production of auto-disable syringes will help ensure low- and middle-income countries have the tools they need to deliver routine and COVID vaccines. 
ENTJ|Getting to zero emissions will be the hardest thing people have ever done. This was a great conversation about the power of innovation and what the world can accomplish if we work together.
ENTJ|I was truly inspired to hear @Vinisha27738476 speak at #COP26 this week. Her optimism and passion for innovation makes me hopeful that we can avoid a climate disaster.
ENTJ|Thank you, @SecGranholm for your leadership. The commitment of @ENERGY and the innovate spirit of our National Labs will drive the breakthroughs we need to help the whole world get to #NetZero.
ENTJ|Public-private collaborations will be critical to reducing emissions and achieving our 2050 climate goals. Our work with @MICleanEnergyRD will help us do just that.
ENTJ|I’m excited about @Breakthrough Energy’s expanded work with @MICleanEnergyRD. Thank you, @JonathanWNV for your partnership.
ENTJ|Thank you, @KensingtonRoyal for your commitment to repairing our planet. It was inspiring to see the ingenuity and innovation of the @EarthshotPrize finalists.
ENTJ|Great to see @naftalibennett’s commitment alongside global leaders present @COP26 today. The world needs bold action to support the development of new technology to slow emissions and help the world adapt to the changing climate.
ENTJ|.@Breakthrough Energy Catalyst is bringing together private and public sector leaders to invest in innovation and accelerate clean technologies. @Citi, @IKEAFoundation, and @StateFarm are joining our efforts to help fund solutions that will ignite a green industrial revolution.
ENTJ|Unless smallholder farmers can adapt to climate change, we will lose the global battle against hunger and poverty. @AIMforClimate is rising to the challenge and supporting major investments in @CGIAR to power agricultural innovation.
ENTJ|Thank you, @vonderleyen. This $1B partnership between @Breakthrough Energy Catalyst, @EUCommission, and @EIB will help accelerate the deployment of critical climate technologies. I’m grateful for our continued collaboration.
ENTJ|Encouraged to discuss with PM @narendramodi on the sidelines of #COP26 the potential of further investments in science, innovation and transformative agriculture R,D as an important foundation for mitigating impact of climate change on small landowning farmers @PMOIndia @nstomar.
ENTJ|One of my top priorities here at #COP26 is making sure that the world prioritizes scaling clean technology innovation. Here is the message I delivered to world leaders earlier today 
ENTJ|In addition to investments in reducing emissions to slow climate change, we need to help those already impacted by climate change adapt. 
ENTJ|By bringing the world together at #COP26, we can find more ways to accelerate the development and adoption of the clean technologies we need to reach net-zero emissions. 
ENTJ|At this year’s UN Climate Conference, innovation will take center stage and I’m optimistic about the road ahead. 
ENTJ|I hope Congress passes the Build Back Better Act and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act fast. We can’t wait another moment. 
ENTJ|Good to see this commitment by @Merck to help ensure from the outset that molnupiravir, a potential treatment for COVID-19, will be available to many more nations. 
ENTJ|To avoid a climate disaster, we need young people’s ideas and energy. College and university students anywhere in the world can download my book for free 
ENTJ|It’s great to see the strong commitment of partners like @MohamedBinZayed and the dedication on the front line to eradicate polio. On #WorldPolioDay we recognize progress and acknowledge that the fight continues.
ENTJ|This week, any college or university student anywhere in the world can download my book How to Avoid a Climate Disaster for free. 
ENTJ|This #WorldPolioDay you can support Shumaila and other polio workers by donating to @Rotary’s fight against polio. Our foundation is giving a 2-to-1 match to every donation. Learn more 
ENTJ|The world needs heroes like Shumaila Rehmani. I’m inspired by the impact she’s making in her community to save lives and help #EndPolio. 
ENTJ|I’ve been binging geography videos lately. I liked this one where Geography King explains several really fascinating quirks of US geography (including why it doesn’t actually rain as much as people think in my hometown). 
ENTJ|India has administered 1 billion vaccine doses, a testament to India’s innovation, ability to manufacture at scale, and the efforts of millions of health workers backed by CoWIN. Congratulations @narendramodi @mansukhmandviya @PMOIndia @MoHFWIndia 
ENTJ|Our funding is only part of the solution. More donors will need to step up to make sure molnupiravir is available to all as quickly as possible.
ENTJ|Everyone deserves equitable access to healthcare. That’s why we engaged partners like @MedsForAll and @OfficialUoM to find more affordable, safe materials that generic manufacturers can use to produce medicines at a lower cost.
ENTJ|We’ve done this before. In 2017, the @gatesfoundation worked with partners and generic suppliers to bring improved HIV therapies to more than 18 million people in lower-income countries.
ENTJ|If we’re going to end the acute phase of the pandemic, life-saving drugs like molnupiravir must be available to everyone who needs them.
ENTJ|By investing in direct air capture, clean hydrogen, long-duration energy storage, and sustainable aviation fuel, we’ll create a new industrial revolution that will power the global clean energy economy 
ENTJ|Earlier today I attended the #GlobalInvestmentSummit where we announced @Breakthrough Energy Catalyst’s latest partnership to accelerate climate technologies. Thanks to the UK government , @10DowningStreet for taking bold action. 
ENTJ|I’m grateful to have joined @BorisJohnson today to highlight the important work that @Breakthrough Energy Catalyst is doing to accelerate clean technologies. Our partnership with the UK will be critical to building the net-zero economy.
ENTJ|Jenn and Nayel, it’s impossible to put into words how happy it makes me to see you filled with joy on your wedding day. I’m so proud of you both for everything you’ve accomplished in your lives so far and everything you will do with your future together. 
ENTJ|Reaching net zero will take bold action and creativity, and the first cohort of @Breakthrough Energy Fellows makes me optimistic that we can propel a new industrial revolution. 
ENTJ|I wrote about two ways to achieve vaccine equity in the future. If the world makes the right investments and decisions now, we can make things better next time. And maybe even make sure there is no next time at all. 
ENTJ|Still, the disparities in access to the COVID-19 vaccine are shocking and unjust. Only 2 percent of people in low-income countries have received any COVID-19 vaccines. And the gap may be getting even larger as rich-world governments buy up extra doses to serve as booster shots.
ENTJ|Inequity in health is not new. Each year, more than 5 million children—almost entirely in low- and middle-income countries—die before their fifth birthday from mostly preventable diseases. Reducing this gap has been the Gates Foundation’s top priority for more than 20 years.
ENTJ|The pandemic has worsened inequities. But its also shown the world whats possible when we come together. Read why theres reason to be optimistic in our 2021 Goalkeepers Report. 
ENTJ|This work has been critical to our understanding of the causes and impacts of climate change. Congratulations on this well-deserved recognition. 
ENTJ|What a fantastic leader Dr. Collins has been. The U.S. is lucky to have amazing scientists and public health professionals like him. He leaves an incredible legacy.
ENTJ|Thanks, as always, @zannymb for the thoughtful conversation. I look forward to continuing to talk with business leaders, governments, and activists at #COP26 about how we can work together to avoid a climate disaster.
ENTJ|No one person can solve climate change on their own. However, if we make breakthroughs in zero-carbon innovations, we can avoid a climate disaster together. Thanks to @KurzGesagt for creating this informative video.
ENTJ|Happy Birthday, President Carter. You set a great example for all of us, and I am always inspired by your amazing work. 
ENTJ|The College @AdvisingCorps is helping students navigate the challenges of continuing their education after high school. 
ENTJ|Girin Beeharry was an extraordinary leader and good friend. I’m saddened by his death and inspired by his work to improve lives in India and around the world.
ENTJ|I’m excited about the launch of @CipherClimate by Breakthrough Energy. The first issue includes an important discussion with U.S. Energy Secretary @SecGranholm and new data showing record amounts of cleantech investment.
ENTJ|Congratulations @trvrb on this well-deserved recognition. Like you, I’m optimistic that we will be able to bring this pandemic to an end. Your work with the @seattleflustudy and many others will also help us to better prepare for future pandemics.
ENTJ|Congratulations @narendramodi on the national launch of Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission. This digital health infrastructure will help ensure equitable, accessible healthcare delivery and accelerate progress on India’s health goals. @PMOIndia @MoHFWINDIA 
ENTJ|What if your smart phone could detect Alzheimer’s? @TheADDFs Diagnostics Accelerator is working to make this a reality 
ENTJ|India is a great example of a country that has invested in its capacity. Today 2/3rds of all the worlds children receive a vaccine that was made in India 
ENTJ|Expanding the geography of vaccine manufacturing to better meet vaccine needs, both for pandemics and routine immunization, is a critical task. 
ENTJ|Thanks for having me on the show, @JKCorden! And thanks to the all of the late night hosts for focusing on this critical challenge. I’m optimistic that we can come together to avoid a climate disaster.
ENTJ|In our recent Goalkeepers report, we share some of the lessons that we’ve learned from the world’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic 
ENTJ|Thanks for the conversation and for your leadership in helping to end this pandemic and prevent the next one.
ENTJ|More than 80% of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered in high- and upper-middle-income countries while less than 1% have been administered in low-income countries. This is both profoundly unfair and hinders progress towards ending the pandemic 
ENTJ|A global response will help the world end the COVID crisis. Im glad to see so many leaders coming together at this U.S.-led virtual Global COVID-19 summit, and look forward to their continued efforts to help the world move out of the acute phase of this pandemic.
ENTJ|Earlier I shared three actions that leaders could take to help the world out of the pandemic. For those who want to go deeper, the @gatesfoundation shares more detail on what’s needed to end this crisis 
ENTJ|There are three things that can be done in the coming months to bring an end to the acute phase of the pandemic and set the world on a different timeline in preparation for the next. 
ENTJ|#WorldAlzheimersDay is an inspiring reminder that hope is on the horizon. Brilliant scientists all over the world are working hard to stop Alzheimer’s disease—and they’re making terrific progress. 
ENTJ|Avoiding a climate disaster will require a new industrial revolution. Im excited to see @Breakthrough Energy Catalyst announce the first private sector anchor partners who will work together to build the clean industries of the future.
ENTJ|As we’ve seen this past year, new variants of a disease can emerge over time. In order to develop new tools to fight the disease, we need to identify those variants quickly. Dr. Senjuti Saha is one expert working to sequence SARS-CoV-2 
ENTJ|But the fact that we can point to positive signs amid a once-in-a-generation global pandemic is extraordinary. With one hand tied behind their backs, countless individuals, organizations, and countries went above and beyond. 
ENTJ|Of course, the full extent of the pandemic’s impact on the SDGs will take years to fully understand, as more and better data becomes available. And this data doesn’t diminish the very real suffering the pandemic has caused for people everywhere—far from it.
ENTJ|Initial projections about the pandemic’s impact on the fight against malaria were dire. But that projection spurred many countries to action to ensure that bed nets were distributed and that testing and antimalarial drugs remained available.
ENTJ|When the pandemic hit, many feared the worst when it came to maintaining progress on fighting other diseases. But all over the world people stepped up to avert the worst-case scenarios. One example is malaria 
ENTJ|Where you live shouldn’t determine whether or not you have access to a Covid-19 vaccine, health supplies, or a diagnostic test 
ENTJ|Even amid the devastation of the COVID-19 pandemic, we’ve seen that progress can continue thanks to work started years earlier. In this year’s #Goalkeepers2030 report, we share some of the lessons that have inspired all of us at the @gatesfoundation. 
ENTJ|This news is not surprising to many of us who work in global health. But there are things the world can do to help get management of these diseases back on track. I’m eager to share more in the annual Goalkeepers report tomorrow. #Goalkeepers2030
ENTJ|I’m thinking today about the frontline heroes who risked their lives for us on September 11th and those who continue to serve our country every day.
ENTJ|The world needs many breakthroughs to get from 51 billion tons of greenhouse gases to zero in order to avoid a climate disaster. It’s encouraging to see this kind of collaboration.
ENTJ|I found the book to be valuable on a number of levels and will have more to say about it soon!
ENTJ|The first time I met David Sengeh, I was blown away by his intellect, his ambition, and his sense of humor. He has been a remarkable advocate for Sierra Leone, and I’m confident that we’ll be hearing about @dsengeh’s amazing work for decades to come. 
ENTJ|Africas success against wild polio last year is one of the most inspiring stories in global health. I’m optimistic that, with the commitment and collaboration that achieved that goal, countries in the region can beat all forms of the virus and #EndPolio 
ENTJ|None of us would be where we are today without the incredible teachers who helped shape our perspectives. Brooke Brown is an extraordinary teacher who has helped her students adapt to extraordinary times. 
ENTJ|.@GAPFoundation’s Bio-Hermes Study is the first to compare results of blood and digital biomarker tests with imaging and traditional cognitive tests. This could help identify Alzheimer’s earlier and detect progression of the disease, to help us get closer to a cure.
ENTJ|Congratulations, India, on reaching this tremendous milestone. The collective efforts of the government, R,D community, vaccine manufacturers, and millions of health workers have made this feat possible. @PMOIndia @MoHFWINDIA 
ENTJ|The COVID-19 pandemic reminds us why eradicating malaria is essential. Many of the building blocks we need to fight malaria and prevent the next pandemic are the same. #MosquitoWeek 
ENTJ|Mosquitoes are the deadliest animal to humans, but @WMPglobal scientists have discovered how to transform one kind of mosquito into a surprisingly powerful ally #MosquitoWeek🦟 
ENTJ|I applaud David Vélez and Mariel Reyes’s pledge to dedicate the majority of their wealth to creating opportunity for the most vulnerable Latin American children and young adults 
ENTJ|This collaboration’s impact is made possible through investments in the bipartisan infrastructure bill, which will unleash billions in private capital for clean energy projects throughout the U.S. if passed into law. Thank you @SecGranholm for your partnership.
ENTJ|Avoiding a climate disaster will require a new, clean industrial revolution, and we dont have time to wait. Our work together will not only send us on a more viable path to net zero, but it will create long-term jobs in communities across the country.
ENTJ|Im incredibly excited about the new collaboration between @Breakthrough Energy Catalyst and @ENERGY to accelerate the adoption of next-generation clean technologies and build the net-zero economy 
ENTJ|I’m partnering with @DonorsChoose to make sure that more teachers have access to everything they need to get ready for the new school year. I’ll give your donation an extra 50% boost today when you give to any classroom project or supply request.
ENTJ|I’m optimistic about the work that @Breakthrough is doing to invest in companies, support innovators, advocate for better policies, and lower the cost of climate tech. Join us. 
ENTJ|Reaching zero will take a complete transformation of how we make and do everything – from the technologies and products we create to our public policies to the way we use markets to accelerate change. We need a new industrial revolution powered by clean technology.
ENTJ|Every climate action we take must be toward the goal of reaching zero. That means rapidly deploying the technologies we have today to reduce emissions and investing immediately in the solutions we still need to get the world to zero.
ENTJ|Avoiding a disaster will require courage, ambition, and partnership among leaders in every sector around the globe. As the report makes clear, no region will be spared by climate change. It will take all of us to meet this challenge.
ENTJ|Today’s United Nations climate report is an urgent call to action for the world we must reach net-zero emissions by 2050 to avoid a climate disaster. 
ENTJ|Alzheimer’s and related dementias have impacted far too many families around the world—including my own. New funding from @TheADDF will help @EDoNInitiative accelerate data collection and sharing to enable early detection and treatment.
ENTJ|Today’s students have the power to create a better future for all people, and teachers are helping them build their framework for understanding the world. Thank you to Bryan Stevenson for joining the @OERProject Conference for Social Studies this week. 
ENTJ|I’m deeply saddened to hear of Tachi’s passing. I loved working with him and I learned a lot from him. His passion for saving lives and making the world a fairer place was inspiring, and he matched it with an incredible intellect. I will miss him.
ENTJ|Vaclav Smil’s books are amazing. His latest will give you a framework to think about humanity 
ENTJ|I enjoyed joining educators from around the world at the @OERProject Conference for the Social Studies to discuss how their teaching practices have changed over the last year and a half. I’m inspired by their resilience and dedication to their students 
ENTJ|The French drank an impressive amount of wine in 1926, but their consumption is now a third of what it was back then. Why? I love how this book forces you to think about the story behind a seemingly niche statistic. 
ENTJ|My favorite author’s new book might be his best one yet. Each chapter covers one of 71 facts about the world that help you understand how history ties together. I unabashedly recommend it to anyone who loves learning. 
ENTJ|Our foundation has been working to address this massive problem for 10 years—here’s one of the incredible Reinvent the Toilet designs that could help 
ENTJ|Ever heard a toilet be compared to an espresso machine? That’s how Dr. Shannon Yee describes the toilet he and his team have developed. 
ENTJ|How much of the world population still lacks access to a toilet that safely removes waste from the home? Find the answer here 
ENTJ|This map from @OurWorldInData shows the progress we’ve made–but also highlights how much work we have left to do. 
ENTJ|You were a good sport, Jimmy. Pro tipnever choose glass #2 in a poop-water challenge 
ENTJ|The Gates Foundation is providing additional, flexible funding to the @AfricaCDC for its pandemic response efforts, but more assistance from the global community is urgently needed to fill the gaps.
ENTJ|Over the years, I’ve shared a stage with a jar of human feces, smelled pit latrine odor, and drunk water made from poop (and convinced @jimmyfallon to drink it too). Was it worth it? You bet. Here’s why 
ENTJ|I’ve been rewatching some of my favorite movies. Add your favorites to the list on @Likewise. 
ENTJ|Getting an early start on my weekend reading this article does a good job explaining immunity and what may happen with COVID-19 in the future. 
ENTJ|During the height of the U.S. polio epidemic, the iron lung was one of the greatest tools used to fight polio. Today, it’s the iron will of the thousands of workers and their supporters who are committed to finishing the job. #endpolio
ENTJ|Our foundation joined the polio fight almost 15 years ago. And in all that time, I cannot think of a more important moment than right now. 
ENTJ|I look forward to working with you and @EUCommission on all of these important goals. Europe is a critical partner in creating a net-zero future and ensuring a healthy and equitable world for all.
ENTJ|Reaching net-zero emissions by 2050 means transforming our entire physical economy and accelerating innovation at an unprecedented pace. @Breakthrough Energy Catalyst will jumpstart this process. 
ENTJ|These students are doing inspiring work. Their ambition makes me optimistic about the future of health care (and the world).
ENTJ|I’m excited about @Breakthrough Energy Catalyst and think it can help make clean-energy innovations more available and affordable for everyone. 
ENTJ|COVID-19 has highlighted how digital tools can save lives. I’m encouraged by @ExemplarsHealth research highlighting how technologies in Nigeria, Sri Lanka, Burkina Faso, Uganda, South Africa, and Vietnam can be scaled to detect and respond to pandemics. 
ENTJ|This expanded commitment to the foundation will accelerate its mission to fight poverty, disease, and inequity around the world. Im grateful to the foundations leadership team, employees, and partners for their dedication to making the world healthier and more just.
ENTJ|Stopping Alzheimer’s requires more eyes on the problem. ADDI @AlzData recently hosted their 1st Data Challenge. I was inspired to see more than 1,200+ people from 65+ countries/regions join the fight. 
ENTJ|It’s really encouraging to see these results. Dengue fever infects hundreds of millions of people a year and causes debilitating disease. This incredible technique could also be effective at stopping the spread of other viruses like Zika and Chikungunya. 
ENTJ|This important commitment builds on the @gatesfoundations efforts to support partners working to create a more equal world.
ENTJ|I am truly grateful for his wisdom and leadership, and most of all for his enduring friendship. Warren will continue to inspire our foundation as we work to fight poverty and help millions of people live healthier lives. 
ENTJ|I will always have a deep sense of accountability to Warren, paying close attention to the data to track our progress and identify areas where we can do better. But the value of Warren’s gift goes beyond anything that can be measured.
ENTJ|Should you pick your nose? You can read an excerpt from Matt Richtel’s fascinating book about the immune system on my blog to find the answer 
ENTJ|The journalist @ElizKolbert has created a fascinating beat for herself covering humanity’s impact on nature and our attempts to control it. Her latest book is a good reminder that we need to watch out for the unforeseen effects of our actions. 
ENTJ|The persistence of countless Rotarians gives me hope that we can achieve a polio-free world. As they close the #Rotary21 Convention, Id like to thank @Rotary for the continued partnership to #endpolio. 
ENTJ|Im almost always interested in books about American presidents, and I especially loved A Promised Land. It’s a fascinating look at what it’s like to steer a country through challenging times. 
ENTJ|This book gave me a deeper, more nuanced appreciation for the system that is at the core of humanity’s fight against COVID-19 and everything our foundation’s Global Health program is trying to do. 
ENTJ|If you’re looking for a good book to read this summer, these are some of my favorites. 
ENTJ|The @G7’s commitment to share 870M COVID-19 vaccine doses over the next year is welcome news - but time is not on our side. Vaccines must be delivered now to help control the pandemic everywhere and not disrupt the progress weve made. 
ENTJ|Polio tools and infrastructure are also critical to combatting other public health emergencies, like COVID-19. It is more important than ever that donors and countries commit to the new GPEI strategy to #endpolio and continue improving health for all. 
ENTJ|These young leaders make me optimistic that brighter days are ahead for America’s students and teachers. 
ENTJ|Against the odds, @MohamedBailorB8 became a doctor and is helping his country recover from civil war, Ebola, and now COVID-19. This doctor’s life story is almost as remarkable as his work. 
ENTJ|This is an important step in the U.S. clean energy transition. I’m excited to see @TerraPower working with @PacifiCorp, @GovernorGordon, and @Energy to bring this project to life with the workforce of Wyoming. 
ENTJ|Heroes like Dr. Mohamed Barrie are the reason we started our foundation more than 20 years ago and why Melinda and I remain committed to its work. Mohamed’s story is truly inspiring, and I can’t wait to see what he and his team will accomplish next. 
ENTJ|This partnership between @Breakthrough Energy and the @EUCommission will create jobs around the world, build sustainable global industries, and expand opportunity for billions Thank you to @EIB as well for your support. 
ENTJ|The pandemic has exacerbated existing racial health inequities in the United States. The Health Equity Tracker is a new tool bringing visibility to disparities in U.S. medicine. 
ENTJ|Avoiding a climate disaster is possible if governments act today. @IEA’s Net Zero by 2050 report provides a roadmap to achieve this critical goal.
ENTJ|I was honored to speak at today’s #LeadersClimateSummit about the three things we need to do to avoid a climate disaster. 
ENTJ|Ambitious short-term goals like this are critical to moving closer to a net-zero future. As we rapidly scale the solutions we have, we must also invest in innovation to reach our ultimate goals. Thank you @POTUS for your leadership. 
ENTJ|It’s encouraging to see @POTUS Biden and @ClimateEnvoy Kerry re-establish America’s leading role on climate change. I look forward to joining leaders from around the world to talk about some of the most important challenges we need to overcome to avoid a climate disaster.
ENTJ|Yesterdays verdict was a step in the right direction. But one court ruling alone will not bring to an end the injustice and inequity that Black people experience daily. I hope we will continue to make real progress on this.
ENTJ|Time is a poetic portrait of a family who love and support each other despite their difficult circumstances. I can’t recommend it highly enough. 
ENTJ|If Time wins the Oscar this year, it will be the first documentary directed by a Black woman to do so. Garrett Bradley’s talent makes her worthy of that milestone. This is one of the most intimate movies I have ever seen. #itsTIME 
ENTJ|Communities of color have been hit hard by COVID-19. One of the reasons why parts of the medical system often fail Black and brown people is because it’s not designed with them in mind. Dr. Stephaun Wallace wants to change that. 
ENTJ|To get to net-zero emissions globally by 2050, leaders from around the world must work together. It’s encouraging to see governments, business leaders, and financial institutions committing to a successful COP26 in Glasgow later this year. 
ENTJ|Dr. Stephaun Wallace (@imstephaunelite) has spent the last year helping make COVID-19 vaccines work for everybody. Stephaun and his colleagues at @FredHutch are working to reach the people who are usually left behind. 
ENTJ|The amount of cement China has consumed is a staggering statistic and reminder of how much emissions have grown in low- and middle-income countries. (Minecraft concrete doesn’t count, though server farms are responsible for a lot of emissions.) 
ENTJ|Cement is responsible for 6% of carbon emissions globally. To get to net-zero by 2050, we need innovations to decarbonize the material. I discuss a few approaches to make low-emission cement in my climate book 
ENTJ|Who installed the most concrete? Check your answer 
ENTJ|The best way to prevent new variants from emerging is by stopping transmission of the virus altogether 
ENTJ|Its encouraging to see innovation and clean energy investments at the forefront of @POTUSs #AmericanJobsPlan. Building markets for new energy technologies is good for jobs today and will build the economies we need while avoiding a climate disaster. 
ENTJ|Here are five things you should know if you want to understand how variants are (and aren’t) complicating the pandemic. 
ENTJ|I had a great time answering questions about my new book, climate change, and COVID-19 on @reddit last week. Here’s a recap of the conversation. 
ENTJ|I’m answering your questions now on @reddit 
ENTJ|I named my book How to Avoid a Climate Disaster, not How to Stop Climate Change, because our climate is already changing—and no one will be hurt more by climate change than the world’s poorest people. Heres how we can help them adapt. 
ENTJ|Congratulations @AndrewSteerWRI on this important role. I’m excited to see what you and the Earth Fund will achieve. Avoiding a climate disaster is going to take all of us, and I’m grateful for @JeffBezos’s leadership and partnership.
ENTJ|Thank you @SalKhanAcademy for a great conversation about climate change and thanks to @BookPeople and @BlueWillowBooks for hosting the event. 
ENTJ|For decades, Australian researcher Ruth Bishop led global efforts to identify and combat rotavirus. Her life is a reminder of the importance of scientific research to uncover unknown pathogens and the power of vaccines to prevent suffering and save lives. 
ENTJ|Thank you @BarackObama for the kind words. Your leadership at the 2015 Paris climate conference helped prove that global cooperation on climate is possible and gives me hope that we can reach our goal of zero emissions.
ENTJ|@EDFaction @Breakthrough Thank you for your partnership, @EDFAction, and for sharing what all of us can do to avoid a climate disaster.
ENTJ|Moving to a green economy is the biggest challenge the world has ever faced. I’m optimistic we can do it, but need to make sure it benefits everyone—including those workers and communities who depend on the fossil fuels that we need to get rid of. 
ENTJ|We can’t avoid a climate disaster without corporate leaders making courageous decisions now. I hope to work with @VWGroup on building the markets for the clean technologies the world needs. Thank you for the kind words, Herbert.
ENTJ|@EUH2020 @EIB @Breakthrough @BloomBiorenewa1 To get to net zero, we need innovation to replace fossil fuels in everyday products like plastics. @BloomBiorenewa1 is one of the many companies leading on this important work.
ENTJ|Were fortunate to have an Energy Secretary whos focused on creating high-quality jobs to build a clean energy economy. I look forward to working with @SecGranholm on clean tech innovation and deployment. 
ENTJ|Recent extreme weather events are a stark reminder that we’re already seeing the effects of climate change here at home and around the world. This type of observation system will help scientists monitor and predict future weather events. 
ENTJ|Thanks @kwelkernbc and @JCCAtlanta for a great conversation about how we can avoid a climate disaster. 
ENTJ|I’m looking forward to joining @andrewrsorkin to talk about climate change, our foundation’s work in response to the pandemic, and more.
ENTJ|It’s encouraging to have @ClimateEnvoy John Kerry representing the U.S. to the world. Now that weve rejoined the Paris Climate Agreement, its going to take ambitious action from U.S. leaders and those around the globe to avoid a climate disaster. 
ENTJ|Thanks @JudyWoodruff and @NewsHour for having me on the show to talk about climate change and COVID-19 – two urgent global issues that need global collaboration. 
ENTJ|@colbertlateshow @gatesfoundation I always have fun talking to @StephenAtHome. Thanks for inviting me to talk about climate change and my new book.
ENTJ|I’m inspired by @DonCheadle’s activism and humanitarian work. Thanks to @lawacthevents and @writersblocla for hosting our discussion about climate change and how everyone can help. 
ENTJ|@smh Thanks @GregCallaghan1 for talking with me about this challenge and why we need to act now.
ENTJ|Meaningful action from business leaders will require the courage to take risks that many companies arent used to taking.
ENTJ|Thanks to @andersoncooper, @SeaArtsLectures, and everyone who joined our virtual conversation about climate change. Great to have so much support from my hometown for this important work. 
ENTJ|Great to see this important step as the United States resumes our global leadership on climate change. Looking forward to working with @POTUS and Congress on a plan to ensure we reach net zero by 2050.
ENTJ|Thanks to @streickercenter for hosting the launch of my virtual book tour. It was great to hear so many thoughtful questions about what we can all do to help avoid a climate disaster.
ENTJ|When I talk to people about climate change, I almost always get asked the same question What can I do to help? Here are some actions individuals can take to move us closer to a zero-carbon future 
ENTJ|Thanks for inviting me on the podcast, @karaswisher.
ENTJ|Thank you, @AlokSharmaRDG. We have a lot of work ahead of us to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 and avoid a climate disaster. Your leadership of #COP26 is critical. Thanks also to @howtoacademy, @penguinlive and @Waterstones for hosting the London stop of my virtual book tour!
ENTJ|It was great to talk with @alroker about my new book and the solutions we need to fight climate change.
ENTJ|@CBSEveningNews @NorahODonnell Thank you @NorahODonnell for inviting me to talk about climate change. Solving it won’t be easy, but I believe we can do it.
ENTJ|Thanks for another great conversation @Trevornoah!
ENTJ|@CliftonLeaf Thanks for inviting me to be a guest editor. We need every business leader and every industry to play a role in the fight against climate change.
ENTJ|I had a great time working with @FortuneMagazine on this special digital issue about climate change. The entire business community has a role to play—and we need to start now.
ENTJ|How to Avoid a Climate Disaster is available now. I hope you’ll check out the book, but more importantly, I hope you’ll do what you can to help keep the planet livable for generations to come 
ENTJ|The world’s power to invent makes me hopeful about climate change. Breakthrough Energy supports the innovations that will lead the world to net-zero emissions. 
ENTJ|To avoid a climate disaster, we need to eliminate emissions from the ways we create electricity, grow food, make things, move around, and heat and cool our buildings. It won’t be easy, but I believe we can do it. This book is about what it will take. 
ENTJ|I enjoyed spending time with @andersoncooper recently in Seattle. We talked about why I’m optimistic that the world can get to zero greenhouse gas emissions and avoid a climate disaster 
ENTJ|I’m thrilled to join @Trevornoah, @AlokSharmaRDG, @iamrashidajones, @andersoncooper, @DonCheadle, @SavannahGuthrie, @kwelkernbc, @daxshepard and Monica Padman, Sal Khan, and Ariel Bissett to discuss how the world can work to avoid a climate disaster 
ENTJ|COVID-19 has cost lives, sickened millions, and thrust the global economy into a devastating recession. But hope is on the horizon 
ENTJ|This has been a year unlike any other in our lifetimes. In our new Annual Letter, Melinda and I talk about how we can turn the hard-won lessons of the pandemic into a healthier, more equal future for all. 
ENTJ|Here are four other ways that America can advance its leadership on climate change this year and put the world on a path to zero emissions by 2050 
ENTJ|One of the benefits of being 65 is that I’m eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine. I got my first dose this week, and I feel great. Thank you to all of the scientists, trial participants, regulators, and frontline healthcare workers who got us to this point. 
ENTJ|It’s great to see President Biden elevate science leadership to a cabinet-level position. Congratulations @ericlander.
ENTJ|And while COVID-19 will rightfully continue to dominate the agenda, the United States also has the opportunity to lead the world in avoiding a climate disaster. The President is taking a great first step by rejoining the Paris Climate Accord.
ENTJ|The President’s commitment to reengage with the world gives me hope that the recovery will reach everyone, including communities of color in the U.S. and people in poor countries around the world.
ENTJ|With Americans across the country working together, more people get a COVID-19 vaccine every day, bringing us closer to a time when life will look much more like normal. Until then, we can slow the spread of the virus and save lives by continuing to distance and wear masks.
ENTJ|I look forward to working with President @JoeBiden and Vice President @KamalaHarris to tackle some of our toughest challenges like COVID-19 and climate change. This has been a troubling time in America, but I see promise in the months and years ahead.
ENTJ|#MLKDay has long been a national day of service. As we celebrate the first without Congressman John Lewis, Im thinking about his powerful call to remain hopeful about the future as we work to make our country—and our world—a better place. 
ENTJ|It’s great to see India’s leadership in scientific innovation and vaccine manufacturing capability as the world works to end the COVID-19 pandemic @PMOIndia 
ENTJ|What does Rashida Jones have on her shopping list? That’s just one of the many questions that didn’t make it into our podcast. You can listen to some of the big questions we did tackle here 
ENTJ|2021 will be better than 2020. Here’s why 
ENTJ|Standing up for science has never been more important. Congratulations to Dr. Anthony Fauci and Dr. Salim Abdool Karim on receiving this honor.
ENTJ|Ive known and learned from @RonConway for more than 40 years. Im glad to see @svangel team up with @bchesky to mentor and support companies working to create more economic empowerment opportunities for people across the world.
ENTJ|This book has nothing to do with viruses or pandemics. But it is surprisingly relevant for these times. @exlarson provides a brilliant and gripping account of another era of widespread anxiety the years 1940 and 1941. 
ENTJ|Monoclonal antibodies are one of the most promising treatments we have for COVID-19, thanks in large part to R,D by Canadian scientists. Because of their generosity, people all around the world will have access to this potentially lifesaving treatment. 
ENTJ|Like many people, I’ve tried to deepen my understanding of systemic racism in recent months. If you’re interested in learning more about the lives caught up in our countrys justice system, I highly recommend @thenewjimcrow by Michelle Alexander. 
ENTJ|The season finale of our podcast features two incredible people who are using their positions as artists to change the world for the better. 
ENTJ|Thanks for the great conversation, Carlos.
ENTJ|Bill Foege and Viktor Zdanov are phenomenal examples of what it means to harness science for global health. A well-deserved honor.
ENTJ|Here are five books that I’d recommend as we wrap up 2020. I hope you find something that helps you—or the book lover in your life—finish the year on a good note. 
ENTJ|Are we actually making progress on climate change? Can we really prevent a climate disaster? In this week’s podcast, Rashida and I take on perhaps our biggest question yet with Pulitzer Prize-winning author @ElizKolbert. 
ENTJ|This new quiz from @Gapminder is a clever way to fight misconceptions and upgrade your worldview about the incredible progress the world has made toward the Sustainable Development Goals to end poverty, fight inequality, and stop climate change 
ENTJ|Rashida Jones and I talked to Yuval Noah Harari about COVID conspiracy theories, the role social media plays in spreading misinformation, and the one lie I choose to believe even though I know it’s not always true 
ENTJ|I believe we can avoid a climate disaster—if we deploy the clean-energy tools we have now wisely, and if we make big breakthroughs that touch every aspect of our physical economy. Creating the National Institutes of Energy Innovation would put us on the right path.
ENTJ|To reduce duplication, focus the government’s efforts, and get the most innovation out of every dollar of funding, we should create a new organization the National Institutes of Energy Innovation.
ENTJ|We need to revolutionize the world’s physical economy—and that will take, among other things, a dramatic infusion of ingenuity, funding, and focus from the federal government.
ENTJ|This the most important thing the U.S. can do to lead the world in innovations that will solve climate change. 
ENTJ|I’m inspired by Quarraisha Abdool Karim and @ProfAbdoolKarim. They are two of the most respected HIV/AIDS researchers in the world. And now they are helping guide the COVID-19 response in South Africa and around the globe. #WorldAIDSDay
ENTJ|I’m a big fan of author @harariyuval and was excited to talk to him about why humanity is so willing to believe falsehoods and what these lies tell us about ourselves—both as individuals and as a society. 
ENTJ|Today is the 25th anniversary of my first book, The Road Ahead. I made a lot of predictions about technology in the book, and it was fun to look back and see what I got right (and what I got wrong). 
ENTJ|This week, Rashida and I ask a big question that has never felt more urgent is inequality inevitable? We spoke with Compton mayor @AjaLBrown and @OppInsights director Raj Chetty about what it’ll take to build a more equal society. 
ENTJ|You can listen to a bonus clip that didn’t make it into our latest episode here 
ENTJ|Nearly forty million people have Alzheimer’s or dementia today. We have no way to stop or even slow the disease at this point, but I’m hopeful the new Alzheimer’s Disease Data Initiative (@AlzData) will speed up progress. 
ENTJ|In our first podcast episode, Rashida Jones and I talked to Dr. Anthony Fauci about what to expect in the coming months and what the world will look like after COVID-19. 
ENTJ|More than 7 million community health workers serve their neighbors around the world, improving access to primary healthcare for their communities. Now they’re doing heroic work to respond to the pandemic. 
ENTJ|Each week, we’ll talk about some of the biggest issues facing our world with special guests including authors, experts, and friends. 
ENTJ|I look forward to working with the new administration and leaders on both sides in Congress on getting the surging pandemic under control, engaging partners around the world on issues like poverty and climate change, and addressing issues of inequality and opportunity at home.
ENTJ|Congratulations to President-Elect Biden and Vice President-Elect Harris. Thank you to the election officials and campaign workers who worked tirelessly to ensure a record number of Americans could cast a ballot and have it counted during such an challenging time for our country.
ENTJ|Here in Washington, we always vote by mail. Its a safe and secure way to shape the future of our country. But regardless of whether you vote by mail or in person this year, I hope you plan to make your voice heard. Visit for more information.
ENTJ|@MohamedBinZayed The UAE is an essential partner in stopping polio in Pakistan. Thank you @MohamedBinZayed for your continued commitment to polio eradication.
ENTJ|For decades, @Rotary has worked tirelessly to #EndPolio. Today, the health infrastructure they’ve built around the world is supporting the COVID-19 response. #WorldPolioDay
ENTJ|I’ve been working for some time on a book about what we need to do over the next decade to avoid a climate disaster. I’m excited that it will be published on February 16. 
ENTJ|It’s inspiring to see so much passion these days for dealing with climate change, and to know that the world has set some ambitious goals for solving it. What we need now are practical plans to reach those goals.
ENTJ|India’s research and manufacturing capacity are critical for fighting COVID-19. Thank you @narendramodi for speaking at today’s Grand Challenges meeting. @PMOIndia
ENTJ|Europe has an opportunity to get its economy back on track in a way that creates good jobs and reinforces its global climate leadership. Here are 55 ideas on how Europe can develop and scale up the innovative technologies well need to reach net-zero. 
ENTJ|The COVID-19 pandemic has set back efforts to end poverty, hunger, and malnutrition. Investing in @CGIAR will speed the recovery by helping farmers adapt to climate change and rebuild food systems after the pandemic (via @Nature). 
ENTJ|.@StephenCurry30’s work in the community is as inspiring as his amazing record on the basketball court. I really appreciated the thoughtful conversation.
ENTJ|Dr. Tunji Funsho’s work with @Rotary was essential in stopping wild polio in Africa and will help create a polio-free world for all. A well-deserved recognition.
ENTJ|This honor is well deserved. COVID-19 is not just a health crisis—it is also now a food crisis, and @WFP is there to respond. I’m inspired by the thousands of people in the organization who have committed their lives to fighting hunger. 
ENTJ|For the last 25 years, Dr. Firdausi Qadri, an immunologist and infectious disease researcher in Bangladesh, has been working to protect entire communities from cholera epidemics. 
ENTJ|I’m excited to see this kind of innovation. Detecting and predicting outbreaks earlier is critical to preventing epidemics. 
ENTJ|The only way to eliminate the threat of COVID-19 somewhere is to eliminate it everywhere. By making sure poor countries are equipped to stop this disease, wealthy countries will help themselves and bring this crisis to an end sooner. 
ENTJ|Understanding this concept can help us measure our progress toward eliminating carbon emissions and serve as a guide to action. 
ENTJ|Developing and manufacturing vaccines won’t end the pandemic quickly unless we also deliver them equitably. Here is why it’s critical that vaccines are distributed in proportion to the global population 
ENTJ|Great to see the UK commit vital funding to ensure COVID-19 vaccines are available for the world’s poorest people. PM @BorisJohnsons plan will improve the way we prepare for future crises like this. 
ENTJ|After 20 years of stunning advances toward global goals to improve health and reduce poverty, the COVID-19 pandemic stopped progress in its tracks. In our foundation’s Goalkeepers report, we survey the damage and discuss how to start reversing it. 
ENTJ|To prevent the worst effects of climate change, we need innovation across all sectors—especially in the hardest to decarbonize sectors—to get us on a viable path to net-zero emissions.
ENTJ|Justice Ginsburg was a trailblazer who devoted her entire career to fighting for equal justice for women, because she knew it would improve life for everyone. America is a better place because of her service. I am inspired by her life and legacy. 
ENTJ|My dad was the real Bill Gates. He was everything I try to be and I will miss him every day. 
ENTJ|Thank you to the heroes everywhere working to keep us safe. I hope their stories inspire you just as much as they have me 
ENTJ|These heroes represent the best of who we can be. Their efforts to solve the world’s challenges demonstrate our values as a society and they serve as powerful examples of how to make a positive difference in the world. 
ENTJ|Clinical trials are critical to helping researchers better understand Alzheimers. Improving how we identify and enroll participants in those trials will accelerate progress on diagnosing and treating the disease. 
ENTJ|I tackle every big new problem by asking two questions Who has dealt with this problem well? And what can we learn from them? @ExemplarsHealth will help to fill the gap in global health knowledge sharing and to accelerate progress in saving lives. 
ENTJ|Of all the things I’ve learned from Warren Buffett (and there have been a lot), the most important might be what friendship is all about. Here’s why he’s a person that I admire as well as like 
ENTJ|.@AbeShinzo, thank you for making the world a healthier and more equitable place. Your understanding of how we can improve global prosperity, through support of organizations like @Gavi, has been truly inspiring. Please now go take care of your own health.
ENTJ|If we’re going to address climate change, we need to find new ways to do things that don’t release greenhouse gases—including how we move around. 
ENTJ|Today we move one step closer toward a world without polio. This is an incredible milestone that’s worth celebrating. It is also an important reminder of what can be accomplished when we work together toward a common goal. 
ENTJ|Mosquito City is home to the world’s largest captive colony of mosquitoes. @IfakaraHealth Institute is doing fascinating research there about mosquito behaviors and finding ways to outsmart them. 
ENTJ|Deaths from malaria have been cut by more than half since the year 2000. Increased bed net use is one of the main reasons why #WorldMosquitoDay
ENTJ|The progress the world has made against malaria is one of the greatest success stories ever. The COVID-19 pandemic only reinforces why eradicating malaria is so essential. 
ENTJ|Move aside, @SharkWeek. This is the still the world’s deadliest killer 
ENTJ|Because of long-standing barriers that are made worse by COVID-19, hundreds of thousands of students with promise may never start college. This would be disastrous for these young people and for the country. Here’s what we’re doing to help 
ENTJ|Teaching special education takes an amazing person to figure out exactly what works for each child. Talking with Washington State Teacher of the Year Amy Campbell gave me an even greater appreciation for these educators 
ENTJ|Our foundation is partnering with @DonorsChoose to support teachers as they get ready to go back to school—in whatever form that takes—and will boost your donations to the classroom project of your choice today. 
ENTJ|I always look forward to meeting Washington’s Teacher of the Year. This year’s recipient, Amy Campbell (@TheMrsCampbell), is a remarkable advocate for her students, and I loved learning about her approach to teaching special ed. 
ENTJ|Bill Foege was instrumental in the effort to eradicate smallpox (and is a personal hero of mine). Here he outlines how lessons learned from that campaign can apply to the fight against COVID-19. 
ENTJ|The world did not do enough to prepare for a pandemic. We can avoid making the same mistake with climate change by 1. Letting science and innovation lead the way 2. Making sure solutions work for poor countries too 3. Getting started now 
ENTJ|Great tips from @CTBergstrom about how to find reliable sources of information and test claims you may see about the pandemic in your social media feeds.
ENTJ|If we learn the lessons of COVID-19, we can approach climate change more informed about the consequences of inaction, and more prepared to save lives and prevent the worst possible outcome. 
ENTJ|In his final words, John Lewis challenges all of us to continue to stand up for what we truly believe. Together, you can redeem the soul of our nation. 
ENTJ|The impacts of COVID-19 are driving worrying increases in malnutrition and health outcomes. However, there are clear actions that can be taken in both the near- and long-term.
ENTJ|In these challenging times, we can’t lose sight of the importance of combatting climate change. I’m excited to hear about how companies like @Microsoft are finding a way to play a role.
ENTJ|Science and innovation will help us beat COVID-19. Dr. Fauci explains why. 
ENTJ|It’s important that we continue to follow scientific data as we look for new tools to aid in the fight against coronavirus. 
ENTJ|I truly believe that if there is faith and hope and determination, we can continue to lay progress and create an American community at peace with ourselves. John Lewis will continue to inspire generations of Americans. 
ENTJ|It’s hard to overstate how important finding a reliable, affordable, and easy-to-use diagnostic is for stopping Alzheimer’s. This is a big step towards that goal. 
ENTJ|Investments in digital technology that strengthen Africa’s food and health security will be critical to help the continent recover and thrive after the pandemic. 
ENTJ|Our best strategy in the age-old fight against the germs is our collaborative, data-based effort to study the world around us and within us. Our best strategy is science. @MaxCRoser explains how vaccines have dramatically improved humanity’s ability to fight infectious disease.
ENTJ|This is a great loss for America, and for everyone who believes in making the world a more just place. John Lewis not only saw that our country could be betterhe never stopped working to make it that way. We need leaders like him more than ever.
ENTJ|Globally, a lack of medical oxygen–needed to treat pneumonia, malaria, and other diseases–leads to hundreds of thousands of deaths each year. @BernardOlayo founded @HewaTele to address this often-overlooked challenge. 
ENTJ|This hero is playing a critical role in Kenya’s preparations to tackle COVID-19 by scaling up medical oxygen supplies that will be needed to keep the most critically ill patients alive. 
ENTJ|I am committed to listening and learning more about systemic racism and what I can do with my actions and words to help create a more equal and just future. Black lives matter.
ENTJ|…in policing, criminal justice, education, health care, housing, the workplace and all other areas of their lives.
ENTJ|The horrifying killings of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor and far too many other Black people—and the protests they sparked—are shining a light on the brutal injustices that Black people experience every day…
ENTJ|I continue to be inspired by all of the volunteers (including many retired health care workers and teachers) on the front lines of the fight against coronavirus each day.
ENTJ|Here are five books to read this summer if you want to learn more about pandemics or are looking for a distraction 
ENTJ|Melinda recommended that I read The Choice, and I’m glad she did. I think many people will find comfort right now from Dr. Edith Eva Egers suggestions on how to handle difficult situations. 
ENTJ|Today is #RedNoseDay. Their work has made an incredible impact to reduce child poverty in the US and around the world. 
ENTJ|The 1918 influenza outbreak is the closest comparison to what we’re living through right now. John Barry does a great job explaining the realities and lessons of that devastating pandemic. 
ENTJ|Most of my conversations these days are about COVID-19 and how we can stem the tide, but I’m also often asked about what I am reading and watching. Here are my 2020 summer book recommendations (plus a few other ideas for things to do at home). 
ENTJ|@narendramodi @gatesfoundation Thank you for the conversation and partnership, @narendramodi. Combating the pandemic requires global collaboration. India’s role is key as the world works to minimize social and economic impact, and pave the way to vaccine, testing, and treatment access for all. @PMOIndia
ENTJ|I’m hopeful that this program will improve our understanding of the coronavirus outbreak in Seattle and provide valuable information about the virus for other communities around the world. 
ENTJ|Class of 2020, these are not easy times. But we will get through them. And with your leadership, the world will be stronger than before. 
ENTJ|There are over 100 different coronavirus vaccine candidates in the works. These candidates take a variety of approaches to protecting the body against COVID-19 
ENTJ|Humankind has never had a more urgent task than creating broad immunity for coronavirus. It’s going to require a global cooperative effort like the world has never seen. But I know we’ll get it done. There’s simply no alternative. 
ENTJ|We dont yet have all the tools we need to stop the novel coronavirus and safely re-open the economy. But they are on the horizon. 
ENTJ|This is a great introduction to computer science concepts for students at all levels. I’m looking forward to joining today’s Code Break.
ENTJ|Halting funding for the World Health Organization during a world health crisis is as dangerous as it sounds. Their work is slowing the spread of COVID-19 and if that work is stopped no other organization can replace them. The world needs @WHO now more than ever.
ENTJ|.@NickKristof does an amazing job capturing the heroism of the health care workers on the front lines of the coronavirus fight. 
ENTJ|On #WorldHealthDay — and every day — I want to thank all of the health heroes for their sacrifices and for keeping us safe. 
ENTJ|I always enjoy chatting with @Trevornoah, even though we had to sit a little bit further apart than usual this time.
ENTJ|It’s encouraging to see the first projects begin from our effort to accelerate safe and effective drugs for #COVID19.
ENTJ|I’m excited to join the @khanacademy Daily Homeroom today to talk about the incredible ways parents, teachers, and students are coming together to keep learning while schools are closed.
ENTJ|If we make the right decisions now—informed by science, data and the experience of medical professionals—we can save lives and get the country back to work. You can read more about my thoughts on #COVID19 on my blog. 
ENTJ|In the meantime, frontline health care workers are making heroic efforts to test and treat patients across the United States and the world. Here in my hometown, Public Health Seattle , King County (@KCPubHealth) is doing incredible work that we should all be very proud of.
ENTJ|All the work that rich countries are doing now to develop vaccines will save lives in developing countries too. Without a vaccine, those countries are at even greater risk than wealthy ones, because it’s even harder for them to do physical distancing and shutdowns.
ENTJ|If everything goes well, there might be an effective vaccine in less than 18 months—the fastest a vaccine has ever been developed. That will depend on decisions we make today, including the federal government investing in building up manufacturing capacity.
ENTJ|Work is going full speed on potential treatments, and vaccines. But people should know that it will take time to prove they are safe and effective and to start making them.
ENTJ|There’s been some progress on more efficient testing methods, such as the self-swab developed by the Seattle Coronavirus Assessment Network. I hope this and other innovations in testing are scaled up across the country soon. 
ENTJ|The federal government needs to step up on testing far more tests should be made available, and we should aggregate the results so we can quickly identify potential volunteers for clinical trials and know with confidence when it’s time to return to normal.
ENTJ|Extreme physical distancing measures will make a big difference in the U.S., but we need a consistent nationwide approach. Until the case numbers start to go down across America—which could take 10 weeks or more—no one can continue business as usual or relax the shutdown.
ENTJ|There’s no question the United States missed the opportunity to get ahead of the novel #coronavirus. But the window for making important decisions hasn’t closed. The choices we and our leaders make now will have an enormous impact. 
ENTJ|I’m inspired by the generosity of everyone who has contributed to this effort to help keep kids learning at home. Thank you to @DonorsChoose and especially the educators who are doing amazing things for their students every day.
ENTJ|One of the questions I am most often asked about the #COVID19 pandemic is how, and when, it will end. This article by @edyong209 does a really good job of outlining the steps we need to take. 
ENTJ|This impressive new tool from @IHMEUW will help hospitals, policymakers, and the general public better understand and prepare for the #COVID19 response in the U.S. 
ENTJ|This is encouraging news, but we still have a lot of work to do. Extreme physical distancing and testing are the best tools we have right now to slow the spread of novel coronavirus. 
ENTJ|There are few people I’ve learned more from over the years–especially about viruses–than Peter Piot. This Q,A with him is an excellent, easy-to-understand primer on #COVID19 
ENTJ|I’ve been impressed by governors across the country including @JayInslee, @NYGovCuomo, @GavinNewsom, @GovMikeDeWine, @GovLarryHogan, and the many others who are guiding their communities through this challenge and providing a model for us all to follow.
ENTJ|Thanks to Norway and Prime Minister @ernasolberg for their ongoing leadership in global health and important investments in vaccines.
ENTJ|The international response will require funding for @CEPIVaccines’s development of a COVID-19 vaccine and for @Gavi. Thanks to @BorisJohnson and the UK for this vital commitment.
ENTJ|Lots of people in Seattle have asked how they can help those impacted by #COVID19 locally. @allinseattle has done a great job identifying organizations who are already on the ground and deploying resources quickly to help our friends and neighbors 
ENTJ|Thanks for your leadership, @rogerfederer. This is an inspiring contribution and will make a big difference for families.
ENTJ|Teachers are doing incredible work to keep kids learning while at home. To help get supplies to those most in need, Melinda and I will double your impact, up to $1 million total, when you give to @DonorsChoose coronavirus relief effort today and tomorrow. 
ENTJ|I’m connecting live with @TEDchris and @WhitPennRod to talk about what our healthcare systems need to tackle the #COVID19 pandemic and prepare for future epidemics.
ENTJ|Thanks @reddit for joining me yesterday to discuss the #COVID19 pandemic and what we can do to prevent the next one. Heres a recap of the conversation 
ENTJ|I’m answering your questions about the #COVID19 coronavirus on @reddit in 10 minutes 
ENTJ|I know many parents are looking for resources and ideas to help their kids continue learning while home. @khanacademy has created daily schedules with interactive contentexercises, videos and articlesfor students in every grade. 
ENTJ|We don’t yet have all the tools we need to fight COVID-19. This is an important step toward having treatments, while we also explore vaccines and diagnostics. Thanks to @wellcometrust and @mastercard for launching this effort with us.
ENTJ|COVID-19 could be a once-in-a-century pandemic, but the good news is that there are steps we can take now to slow its impact and help us respond more effectively when the next epidemic arrives. #COVID19 
ENTJ|Melinda and I have met many stunted children in our travels. It’s heartbreaking and utterly preventable. Dr. @kopanomabaso is leading an incredible effort to eliminate child stunting from South Africa over the next decade. 
ENTJ|Climate change is one of the toughest challenges the world has ever taken on. But I believe we can avoid a climate catastrophe if we take steps now to reduce emissions and find ways to adapt to a warmer world. Here’s how we’re approaching the challenge 
ENTJ|When Warren Buffett donated the bulk of his fortune to our foundation and joined us as a partner in its work, he urged us to swing for the fences. All these years later, that advice still guides how we think about our philanthropy 
ENTJ|Diseases that cause dementia are only diagnosed after symptoms start. To effectively treat these diseases, we need to be able to diagnose them decades earlier when they first take hold in the brain.
ENTJ|We’re hopeful that our foundation’s work with Networks for School Improvement will help increase the number of Black, Latinx, and low-income students who graduate from high school and pursue postsecondary opportunities. Here’s why that’s so important 
ENTJ|It was a magical night. Im very happy to support your foundations incredible work.
ENTJ|Science is giving us the opportunity to improve lives around the world faster than ever before. Today I was honored to give a speech on this subject at the @aaas annual meeting. #AAASmtg 
ENTJ|This is an incredible story about the power of vaccines. 13 million people are alive today thanks to @Gavi. Here’s how 
ENTJ|The only way well achieve net-zero carbon emissions is if we innovate, deploy, and invest across all sectors. Its encouraging to see companies working to get our planet one step closer. Congratulations to all the winners of the #BreakthroughCanada initiative.
ENTJ|In our new annual letter, @melindagates and I write about why we think the risks we’ve taken in the first two decades of our foundation have set us up for future progress. 
ENTJ|@rogerfederer @RafaelNadal @Trevornoah Roger’s foundation partners with local NGOs in six countries in southern Africa to improve early learning and basic education. It’s an impressive organization, and I encourage you to consider supporting its work 
ENTJ|I’m excited to team up with @rogerfederer again for the Match in Africa Friday in Cape Town. Playing alongside Roger is always a thrill, and I can’t wait to face off against @RafaelNadal and @Trevornoah. 
ENTJ|Thank you, Sue, for all of your contributions to our foundation. I look forward to continuing our work together on important health and education projects that will improve lives.
ENTJ|Game on!
ENTJ|If the world keeps up the fight against these neglected tropical diseases, we can improve the lives of millions of families #WorldNTDDay 
ENTJ|The world has only begun to tap into all the ways AI will help people live healthier lives. I’m excited about the launch of @Microsoft’s new AI for Health initiative, which connects researchers and organizations with world-class AI talent and resources. 
ENTJ|I joined @Twitter ten years (and a couple of days) ago. These are some of my favorite . What’s your favorite tweet from the last ten years? 
ENTJ|@gavi There are still too many children—many living in some of the hardest-to-reach places on the planet—who aren’t getting basic vaccines. Gavi is the best tool we have to reach them. #VaccinesWork
ENTJ|For twenty years, @gavi has worked to ensure that every child in the world is protected from preventable diseases. The results are incredible. But their work is far from done.
ENTJ|I had a fascinating conversation with Vaclav Smil about what bacteria, babies, empires, and economies all have in common 
ENTJ|Its great to see Microsofts leadership in this area. Avoiding the worst effects of climate change will require innovation and investment to get us to net zero carbon emissions across all sectors of the economy.
ENTJ|It’s encouraging to see these results. Typhoid is especially deadly for young children, and a vaccine like this has the potential to save millions of lives. 
ENTJ|Thanks to the work of this father–daughter dynamic duo, Bangladesh is moving toward a future of fewer disease outbreaks and more children reaching their fifth birthday. 
ENTJ|Solving the world’s toughest challenges—like fighting the worst impacts of climate change—requires lots of new ideas and talented people working across many fields. I’m glad to see this effort to support this important work.
ENTJ|Progress isn’t always easy to see. These charts show some of the ways that the world is getting better. 
ENTJ|America’s tax system will be top of mind for many in 2020. Here’s what I really think. 
ENTJ|I’m glad @beautifulnews is highlighting some of the amazing things happening in the world. 
ENTJ|Vaclav Smil is one of my favorite thinkers, and I couldn’t wait to get my hands on his new book about the growth of everything. 
ENTJ|What’s next for our foundation? I’m particularly excited about what the next year could mean for one of the best buys in global health vaccines. 
ENTJ|I’ve read a lot of books about history over the years, and These Truths by Jill Lepore is the most honest and unflinching account of the American story I’ve ever seen. It’s also one of the most beautifully written. 
ENTJ|Check out my end of year books list (plus a bonus recommendation) on @Likewise. 
ENTJ|December is a great time to take stock of everything you’ve done over the last twelve months—including all of the books you’ve read. I found these books to be really clever and engaging. I hope you them find as intriguing as I did 
ENTJ|Back in my early Microsoft days, I routinely pulled all-nighters when we had to deliver a piece of software. I even stayed up two nights in a row on occasion–I don’t recommend that. This book taught me a lot about the importance of a better nights sleep. 
ENTJ|This new treatment is a gamechanger for millions of people living with HIV in South Africa. I’m optimistic that it could help #EndAIDS around the world. 
ENTJ|I was deeply moved by Tayari Jones’s story of a married couple whose lives get torn apart by an incident of injustice. The book is so well-written that you’ll find yourself sucked into it despite the heavy subject matter. 
ENTJ|Here are two amazing statistics primary health care interventions could save 60 million lives in low-and middle-income countries and increase average life expectancy by 3.7 years by 2030 #HealthForAll 
ENTJ|Diane Tavenner had a simple but very ambitious goal We wanted to teach kids not just what they needed to get into college, but what they needed to live a good life. You can read an excerpt from her wonderful new book on my blog. 
ENTJ|I’ve read a lot of great books this year. Here are some I think you’ll enjoy reading over the holidays. 
ENTJ|Thank you, Sue, for your extraordinary leadership. Melinda and I are grateful for the opportunity we’ve had to learn with and from you over the past five-and-a-half years, and we wish you and your family the best.
ENTJ|I really enjoyed sitting down with @reidhoffman to talk about the role great cofounders and partners have played in my career, like Paul Allen at Microsoft and @melindagates at the Gates Foundation. You can listen to our conversation here 
ENTJ|I was impressed to see the tremendous impact @Gestamp’s apprenticeship program is having on students and their community 
ENTJ|This #WorldAIDSDay, I’m excited about breakthroughs in treating and preventing HIV thanks to organizations like the @GlobalFund. 
ENTJ|The world has made incredible strides toward ending the AIDS epidemic over the last twenty years, and I’m optimistic that more progress is on the way. Explore the data #WorldAIDSDay
ENTJ|At @Gestamp, an auto parts maker in Chattanooga, Tennessee, I saw how the factory is putting high school students on a path to opportunity 
ENTJ|Dr. LeAndrea Ware is one of the most energetic school leaders I’ve ever met. Her positivity is infectious. It’s no wonder she was recently named the Tennessee principal of the year 
ENTJ|We’re getting closer to having a blood test for Alzheimer’s – which could help doctors detect and diagnose the disease earlier 
ENTJ|US education may be the hardest issue our foundation works on. A recent visit to The Howard School in Chattanooga, Tennessee reminded me why it’s also one of the most inspiring. 
ENTJ|You could find wild poliovirus in 125 countries in 1988. Today, it exists in just two. And more than 18 million people are walking today who would otherwise have been paralyzed by polio. Here’s why we aren’t done yet 
ENTJ|The incredible, diverse global partnership that halted wild polio’s spread in Nigeria 3 years ago makes me optimistic we’ll #EndPolio worldwide. 
ENTJ|Some of our most vital partners in the fight to #EndPolio are philanthropies like @alwaleedphilan, @bloombergdotorg, Tahir Foundation, Dalio Philanthropies , Ningxia Yanbao Charity Foundation. Their support has helped deliver vaccines and protect millions from polio paralysis. 
ENTJ|Even a single child paralyzed by polio is one too many, but I’m optimistic that we will eradicate the disease thanks to the GPEI’s persistence and creativity. 
ENTJ|In Abu Dhabi this week, the world committed $2.6B to #EndPolio. Thank you @MohamedBinZayed for your leadership in helping push this terrible disease to the brink of eradication. 
ENTJ|@narendramodi .@narendramodis leadership has been a catalyst to Indias progress on improving health, nutrition and ensuring safe sanitation practices for many. @PMOIndia
ENTJ|The more I’ve learned about Alzheimer’s disease, the more I’ve come to admire the volunteers who participate in clinical trials, and their caregivers too. Here’s a way you can help fight Alzheimer’s 
ENTJ|Better tools for collecting and sharing data will help community health workers protect families in the poorest parts of the world. 
ENTJ|Expanding the diversity of therapies in the pipeline and more efficiently recruiting patients for clinical trials will increase our odds of discovering a breakthrough. I’m hopeful it will lead to an intervention that reduces the impact of Alzheimer’s.
ENTJ|@ewarren I’m always willing to talk about creative solutions to these problems.
ENTJ|@ewarren I greatly respect your commitment to finding ways to address wealth inequality and poverty at home. While we may disagree about some of the ways to get there, we certainly agree we need a lot of smart people committed to finding the path forward.
ENTJ|@ewarren You and the other candidates are having a really interesting conversation on how to solve some of the world’s toughest problems like eliminating global poverty and avoiding a climate disaster (though those issues don’t get talked about as much as they should).
ENTJ|One of the many awful things about watching someone you love struggle with Alzheimer’s is the feeling of helplessness. You keep thinking that there must be something more you can do. Heres one option. 
ENTJ|We have cut the number of child deaths in half over the last 20 years. New tools like these precision maps from @IHMEUW will help us cut child mortality in half again by 2030. 
ENTJ|Buildings are one of the five areas where we need a lot of innovation if we’re going to avoid a climate disaster. I wrote about one company with a particularly clever approach. 
ENTJ|A lot of work remains, but it’s exciting to see positive data on a drug candidate that may alter the course of Alzheimer’s disease. 
ENTJ|I always like to try out a new TV show or two when I’m on the road. What should I watch next? I set up an Ask on @Likewise to collect your recommendations. 
ENTJ|This is a solvable problem. @CarbonCure (which I’ve helped fund through @btenergy Ventures) has developed an innovative way to reduce cements carbon footprint 
ENTJ|One of the best parts of my job is getting to work with some of the world’s most brilliant minds on seemingly intractable problems. Here’s how we’re trying to tackle one of the defining technical challenges of our time. 
ENTJ|This is one of the most important topics in medicine today how can we make data more readily available for researchers to look for patterns and identify new pathways for treatment. 
ENTJ|The world has made incredible progress toward the goal to #endpolio thanks to partners like @MohamedBinZayed and the UAE.
ENTJ|Melinda and I feel pressure to make every dollar and every day count, which is why we say no to a lot more opportunities than we say yes to. Working with partners around the world to #EndPolio has been a fight worth every dollar. 
ENTJ|Tackling the world’s toughest health challenges requires the best that science has to offer. Thank you to @NIHDirector and @WHOAFRO for your partnership. 
ENTJ|Congrats to the 2019 winners of the @NobelPrize in chemistry! Few inventions have changed our lives as much as the battery, and the quest to build a better one is an important step in the fight against climate change.
ENTJ|Malnutrition is the single greatest health inequity in the world. In its 2019 State of the World’s Children report, @UNICEF takes a critical look at how we can help everyone reach their full potential by improving access to nutrition.
ENTJ|The world’s poorest people often rely on farming both to feed their families and to earn an income. They will be among the first to face the effects of climate change. I’m excited about innovations aimed at addressing this problem 
ENTJ|Congrats to Esther Duflo, Abhijit Banerjee, and Michael Kremer for winning this year’s @NobelPrize in economics. I’ve learned a lot from their pioneering work to better understand the complexities of the lives of the world’s poorest people. 
ENTJ|The world is facing a crisis at the dinner table, one that climate change will only worsen. I’m optimistic about the progress being made by @RIPEproject on a much-needed breakthrough.

ENTJ|Whenever I want to understand something better, I pick up a book. Here are some of the best ones I’ve read so far this year #BookLoversDay 
ENTJ|There is no question that reliable electricity unlocks a better life for people. But can we power the world without contributing to climate change? I think we can

ENTJ|Time is of the essence. People are dying from fentanyl and violence. We hope to hear soon about a designation of Operation Overdrive for San Francisco to combat the cartels. Read my full letter to Attorney General Garland here 
ENTJ|While SF has an ongoing, increasingly robust public health response, we need law enforcement targeted at the cartels – which promote overdose deaths and violent crime. Operation Overdrive would unlock more federal resources to deter fentanyl trafficking and ensure public safety.
ENTJ|In San Francisco, we share a strong sense of community and the overall safety in our City. But we have a specific concern about the fentanyl crisis. Thats why Im requesting from @TheJusticeDept a designation of Operation Overdrive for San Francisco.

ENTJ|Our Congressional delegations visit to Armenia last year reaffirmed that the Congress is committed to Armenias stability, security and democracy. Today, and every day, America remains fully committed to this mission.
ENTJ|In 2019, Congress recognized the atrocities committed by the Ottoman Empire as genocide. When he took office, @POTUS kept his promise to officially recognize the Armenian Genocide. By affirming the history of this tragedy, we work to make sure such horror can never again happen.
ENTJ|Armenian Genocide Remembrance Day honors the 1.5 million Armenians killed 108 years ago in a horrific genocide. Last year, our delegation had the solemn honor to visit the Tsitsernakaberd Armenian Genocide Memorial and pay respects to the men, women , children who were murdered.

ENTJ|Today’s ruling by the Supreme Court is the right decision for millions of women nationwide. But it is only temporary. The fight to protect women’s health freedom is not over yet. As this case proceeds, Democrats will never stop fighting to ensure access to this vital medication.

ENTJ|Restricting access to mifepristone has no basis in law or science, denies women safe , effective medication, , threatens access to thousands of life-saving drugs. Democrats will always fight for women’s right to choose. I support @TheJusticeDept challenging this reckless ruling.

ENTJ|Democrats are fighting back, because every woman everywhere must have the freedom to get the reproductive care that they need.

ENTJ|Today, an extremist Republican-appointed judge recklessly ruled to block nationwide access to safe and effective abortion medication that has been on the market for decades. Republicans will never rest in their cruel, tyrannical quest to disrespect a woman’s right to choose.

ENTJ|The Grand Jury has acted upon the facts and the law. No one is above the law, and everyone has the right to a trial to prove innocence. Hopefully, the former President will peacefully respect the system, which grants him that right.
ENTJ|Today, a GOP-appointed federal judge ruled to eliminate free, life-saving preventative health care – like cancer screenings , immunizations – guaranteed by the ACA. Every day, MAGA Republicans prove that they will stop at nothing to rip away health care from America’s families.
ENTJ|When Democrats enacted the Inflation Reduction Law, our nation took a landmark step to rescue the planet. Republicans legislation threatens the progress were making to fight the climate crisis, ignores the needs of Americas working families and puts Polluters Over People. 
ENTJ|Yesterday, it was my privilege to meet with Chairman Richard Gere and @SaveTibetOrg. The Tibetan people continue to suffer oppression at the hands of the CCP, and I am proud to support their work defending their faith, their language and their way of life. 
ENTJ|One year ago, a major step forward in our fight for equality was taken when @POTUS signed the Emmett Till Antilynching Act into law. We must continue to fight against racism, hatred and violence in all its forms and for a future free of fear and discrimination.

ENTJ|13 years ago today, America took a giant leap forward as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was enshrined into law. It was my honor to meet with @ProtectOurCare and heroic advocates whose lives have been touched by this landmark law, as they shared their stories. 
ENTJ|The Affordable Care Act has stood the test of time, welcoming millions of families onto affordable insurance plans and driving down out-of-pocket costs. And when Republicans tried to repeal the ACA, Democrats, advocates and activists defeated their monstrous plan.
ENTJ|As we celebrate this joyous day of 13 years of the Affordable Care Act, we know that more needs to be done we must reduce the cost of insulin and prescription drugs for all Americans, we must expand Medicaid in all states, and we must expand access to mental health care.
ENTJ|The ACA has stood for the last 13 years as a pillar of health and financial security for America’s working families. Now, America is healthier, because in America, health care is more affordable and accessible than ever before.

ENTJ|Whatever the Grand Jury decides, its consideration makes clear no one is above the law, not even a former President of the United States. The former president’s announcement this morning is reckless doing so to keep himself in the news , to foment unrest among his supporters.

ENTJ|Read my full statement on House Republicans Anti-Choice Resolution here 
ENTJ|Today, instead of joining Democrats to condemn all political violence, @HouseGOP chose to push their extreme anti-choice agenda. Democrats believe everyone deserves the freedom to access reproductive health services – without fear of violence, intimidation or harassment.
ENTJ|101 years ago today, the first insulin dose was used to treat diabetes, a lifesaving discovery. Now, Democrats #InflationReductionAct has made this vital drug more affordable by capping the out-of-pocket cost at $35 for millions of Americans on Medicare — without 1 GOP vote!
ENTJ|From fine arts museums to theater troupes, the arts are a force for unity , play a critical role in San Francisco’s economy. This $1.4 million investment by @NEAarts in San Francisco’s artistic development further weaves the cultural tapestry of our City. 
ENTJ|My prayers are with the families who have lost loved ones in the severe California floods and with our brave first responders. Governor @GavinNewsom , @POTUS Bidens emergency declaration will allow more resources to save lives and aid recovery. Please heed all safety warnings.
ENTJ|This new MAGA Majority in the House will always choose its rich donors and political interests over the well-being of working families. @HouseDemocrats are fighting back against this extreme agenda — because we put #PeopleOverPolitics. 
ENTJ|Last summer, Democrats enacted the Inflation Reduction Act bolstering resources to ensure the wealthiest few , greediest corporations will pay what they owe. Now, Republicans want to rip away these resources, which will drive up the deficit , let wealthy tax cheats off the hook.
ENTJ|It is shameful, but not surprising, that @HouseGOP’s first order of business in this Congress is to protect corporate America and ultra-wealthy individuals who are illegally avoiding taxes.
ENTJ|Today, we remember the 6 Arizonans murdered and 13 wounded in Tucson 12 years ago. All are in awe of @GabbyGiffords — a beacon of courage, resilience and hope in the face of hardship. Strengthened by her leadership, we’ll never stop fighting for a future free of gun violence.

ENTJ|Read my full statement on Two Years Since the January 6th Insurrection here 
ENTJ|The January 6th insurrection was a day of unimaginable horror, but also of extraordinary heroism, as our courageous law enforcement officers protected the Capitol. We are grateful to these heroes, and we continue to pray for the fallen, the afflicted and their families. 
ENTJ|On January 6, 2021, our nation watched in horror as a terrorist mob stormed the Capitol grounds in a violent attempt to subvert the peaceful transfer of power. As we commemorate this dark day, let us pray that we heal the wounds that remain , work to preserve American Democracy.

ENTJ|All who serve in the House share a responsibility to bring dignity to this body. Sadly, Republicans cavalier attitude in electing a Speaker is frivolous, disrespectful and unworthy of this institution. We must open the House and proceed with the Peoples work.
ENTJ|It was my privilege today to gavel out the end of the 117th Congress — an extraordinarily productive session #ForThePeople. I look forward to continuing to serve the people of San Francisco in the 118th Congress and will share more on this account. 
ENTJ|From my family to yours, have a Happy, Healthy New Year! 
ENTJ|Read my full statement on the passing of His Holiness Pope Benedict XVI here 
ENTJ|I am always moved by Pope Benedict’s encyclical, God is Love, where he quotes St. Augustine highlighting our duty as public servants to fight for justice. May it be comfort to Pope Francis and the Vatican community that so many pray for Pope Benedict during this sad time.
ENTJ|Paul and I join our fellow Catholics in mourning the passing of Pope Benedict XVI a leader whose devotion, scholarship and message stirred the hearts of people of all faiths. It was my privilege to visit His Holiness in the Vatican and to welcome him to our nation’s capital. 
ENTJ|Personally, it was my privilege to sit down with Barbara several times — from news programming to The View — and see her masterful work firsthand. Her passing is a great loss — but her legendary legacy will inspire generations of newswomen. May she rest in peace.
ENTJ|Barbara Walters was a trailblazer and an icon transforming television journalism with her intellect and integrity, courage and poise. For decades, she never shied away from asking the tough questions to people in power, and she never tired in her relentless pursuit of truth.
ENTJ|Thank you to all of the hard-working Members and staff of these Select Committees. Your important contributions over the last two years have made a difference to the Congress and to our Country.

ENTJ|Join His Excellency @ZelenskyyUa, President of Ukraine and me at the United States Capitol ahead of his address to a Joint Meeting of Congress. 
ENTJ|As a fellow Baltimore native, I am particularly proud that Justice Marshall, a deeply admired jurist and a trailblazing champion of civil rights, will soon take his place amid the Capitol’s pantheon of great American patriots. 
ENTJ|Today, Congress proudly sends to @POTUS a bill to remove the Capitol’s bust of Roger Taney – author of the horrendous Dred Scott decision. In its place, the bill commissions a new statue of pioneering Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall. 
ENTJ|President Zelenskyy’s courageous, patriotic, indefatigable leadership has rallied not only his people, but the world, to join the frontlines of the fight for freedom. We look forward to hearing his inspiring message of unity, resilience and determination.

ENTJ|The American people deserve to know without question that no one is above the law. From Day One, @RepRichardNeal has brought immense integrity to the committee’s vital oversight and legislative responsibilities.
ENTJ|The @WaysMeansCmte’s solemn oversight work has revealed the urgent need for legislation to ensure the public can trust in real accountability and transparency during the audit of a sitting president’s tax returns – not only in the case of President Trump, but for any president.
ENTJ|Here at home, the package reforms the Electoral Count Act to thwart future assaults on our Democracy. This week, the House will take up this package – keeping government open and working #ForThePeople. 
ENTJ|The omnibus delivers disaster relief to victims of hurricanes , wildfires throughout our country, for the water crisis in Jackson, MS, and $1 billion for Puerto Rico’s electrical grid. With Community Project Funding, needs of families , communities in our districts are also met.

ENTJ|@HouseDemocrats are committed to advancing liberty, justice and prosperity for all – in the states, in Puerto Rico, in the District of Columbia and across the territories. 
ENTJ|The Puerto Rico Status Act will empower the people of Puerto Rico to choose for themselves how to move forward statehood, independence or sovereignty in free association with the United States.
ENTJ|For more than a century, Puerto Rico has been governed under a political system imposed by outside forces rather than established by its people. Denied the right to a vote in Congress or for President, Puerto Rico’s territorial status has left it vulnerable to unequal treatment.
ENTJ|Todays passage of #HR8393 is a key step to ensure Puerto Rico’s future is one of its own choosing. With the Puerto Rico Status Act, the House voted to tear down the vestiges of colonialism – honoring the dignity, equality and rights of more than 3 million American citizens.
ENTJ|Join me live at the U.S. Capitol for my weekly press conference. 
ENTJ|I am forever grateful to my colleagues in the Caucus for their courage to elect the first woman Speaker. It’s been my honor to help to forge historic progress For The People.

ENTJ|In the decade since Newtown, countless more communities across the country have been scarred by the daily carnage of gun violence. Today, and every day, let us reaffirm our resolve to stop the bloodshed and build a safer world for our children. 
ENTJ|More must be done to save lives – which is why @HouseDemocrats have passed legislation to reinstate the Assault Weapons Ban, more efficiently warn communities during an active shooting and secure universal background checks. We will not rest until these vital measures become law.

ENTJ|As I said at COP27, we have a moral responsibility to our children – to ensure they have clean air to breathe, clean water to drink and a healthy planet to call home. Today, and every day, let us renew our resolve to honor that sacred obligation. 
ENTJ|We have also taken action to bolster climate resilience with our Infrastructure Law and supercharge technological innovation with our CHIPS and Science Act. Crucially, equity lies at the heart of our climate agenda, with 40% of our investments going to underserved communities.
ENTJ|This year, @POTUS Biden and Congressional Democrats proudly enacted the largest climate investment in history – empowering our nation to slash carbon pollution by 40% this decade and setting us on the path to a net-zero, clean energy future.

ENTJ|.@POTUS, @SecBlinken , @RepGregStanton should be commended in their work to help secure her release. Congress stands firmly with the Administration as they continue working to secure the release of Paul Whelan , other Americans unjustly detained in Russia. 
ENTJ|For nearly 10 months, Brittney Griner suffered unthinkable trauma as she was wrongfully imprisoned by Russia. Putin’s cruelty against Brittney – and his monstrous actions against Ukraine – are reminders of his brazen contempt for human rights, human dignity and the rule of law.
ENTJ|Congress and the Country are overjoyed to learn that, thanks to the committed , focused leadership of @POTUS, Brittney Griner is finally free. Today, our hearts are with her dear wife, Cherelle, and the Griner family as their beloved Brittney is safely on her way back to America.

ENTJ|He often reached across the aisle upholding his values, from protecting women’s health freedom to reforming immigration, and conserving Arizona’s lands. His courage to become the 2nd openly gay Republican elected to Congress was admired by his colleagues and countless Americans.
ENTJ|It is with great sadness that we join the people of Arizona in mourning the loss of Congressman Jim Kolbe. Whether in the Navy, the State Senate or the House of Representatives, Congressman Kolbe was a passionate public servant, who always defended his southern Arizona community.
ENTJ|Congratulations to @USMNT on a remarkable run in the World Cup. You fought hard until the very end, and you’ve made our nation very proud. The future is bright! 🇺🇸

ENTJ|.@HouseDemocrats are grateful to @RepJerryNadler, @RepCicilline and advocates across America for their leadership on this legislation, which the House proudly advanced earlier this year. Next week, the House will send this final bill to the President. 
ENTJ|Once signed into law, the Respect for Marriage Act will prevent right-wing extremists from uprooting legal precedent, tearing away fundamental freedoms and upending the lives of families across the country.
ENTJ|Since the Supreme Court’s monstrous decision overturning Roe, extreme MAGA Republicans have set their sights on additional freedoms. In his opinion, Clarence Thomas explicitly called on the Court to reconsider the right to marriage equality handed down in its Obergefell decision.
ENTJ|Today, the Senate took an historic step forward in Democrats’ fight to defend freedom, dignity and equality. The Respect for Marriage Act will uphold marriage equality under federal law – tearing the bigoted, unconstitutional Defense of Marriage Act’ off the books for good.
ENTJ|Today, I proudly signed the Speak Out Act – bipartisan legislation prohibiting non-disclosure agreements from silencing survivors of sexual assault and harassment. This is an historic victory for justice and dignity empowering survivors and building safer workplaces for all. 
ENTJ|Join Members of the North Carolina Delegation, @NatlParkService and me live at the U.S. Capitol to light this years Christmas tree from the Pisgah National Forest in North Carolina. 
ENTJ|May it be a comfort to his loving wife Colette, their dear children Mac, Briana and Alexandra, grandchild Gael and the entire McEachin family that so many join them in mourning during this sad time. 
ENTJ|He will be deeply missed by his colleagues, and he leaves behind a legacy that will improve the lives of all of our children for generations to come.
ENTJ|A respected voice on @EnergyCommerce , @NRDems, he advocated to lower costs, expand broadband access , protect families from gun violence. His contributions to @ClimateCrisis laid the groundwork for our climate action, especially the progress toward environmental justice.
ENTJ|For 2 decades, Congressman McEachin was a distinguished leader on climate in Richmond serving in both the House of Delegates and the State Senate. Congressman McEachin understood that families in communities all across America deserve clean air, clean water , a healthy planet.
ENTJ|It is with great sadness that I join Virginians in mourning the loss of Congressman Donald McEachin a tireless champion for Virginia families and a force for economic opportunity and environmental justice.
ENTJ|From my family to yours, Happy Thanksgiving! 
ENTJ|To the heartbroken families in Chesapeake and throughout Virginia, know that we stand with you and grieve with you at this horrific time. Americans know too well the trauma this inflicts on our communities, and we must never relent in our fight to stop senseless gun violence.
ENTJ|The House looks forward to promptly receiving and reviewing these documents, and we extend our deepest thanks to @RepRichardNeal for his deliberate, principled leadership in the fight to advance ethical, transparent governance #ForThePeople. 
ENTJ|These documents are vital to meeting the House’s Constitutional mandate guarding the public interest, defending our national security and holding our public officials to account.
ENTJ|The Supreme Court’s commonsense decision will allow the IRS to comply with federal law and deliver the former President’s tax returns to @WaysMeansCmte.
ENTJ|Today’s Supreme Court ruling upholds our Democracy, the rule of law and the Congress’ ability to execute its legislative and oversight responsibilities. Now, the Congress must enact legislation requiring Presidents and candidates for President to disclose their tax returns.
ENTJ|Join @LondonBreed, local elected officials, faith leaders and me in San Francisco for an interfaith service in honor of Thanksgiving to celebrate the love and unity that tie our city together and give thanks for the strength we draw from each other. 
ENTJ|Happy birthday, @POTUS! Thank you for all you have done on behalf of America’s working families. 
ENTJ|Thank you to the heroic individuals who stopped the gunman , to the brave first responders at the scene. May it be a comfort to the loved ones of those murdered , the Colorado Springs community that America mourns with them during this devastating time. 
ENTJ|The attack on Club Q, on the eve of Transgender Day of Remembrance, is despicable — further shattering the sense of safety of LGBTQ Americans across the country. While Democrats have taken steps to combat gun violence, this deadly attack is a reminder that we must do more.
ENTJ|Americans awoke this morning to horrific news a brutal attack on an LGBTQ nightclub in Colorado Springs. Our hearts break at the senseless slaughter of least five beautiful souls and the many more injured or forever traumatized, at what was a sanctuary of safety and solidarity.
ENTJ|Together, we will continue forging a safer, more just America – one where all of its people can freely and proudly exercise their right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. 
ENTJ|Horrified by such shameless bigotry, House Democrats are proud to march alongside our trans friends, neighbors and siblings as we work to uphold justice for all. That is why we have enacted fully-inclusive federal hate crime protections and twice passed the Equality Act.
ENTJ|Today, and every day, let us offer comfort to grieving loved ones, honor those killed and continue fighting to save lives from the wicked forces of hate. That fight is more urgent than ever, as right-wing extremists target transgender Americans’ fundamental rights and freedoms.
ENTJ|As our nation marks Transgender Day of Remembrance, @HouseDemocrats mourn the countless Americans stolen away by the scourge of transphobic violence, a crisis that continues to disproportionately harm trans people of color.
ENTJ|A new day is dawning on the horizon. And I look forward to the unfolding story of our nation. A story of light and of love. Of patriotism and of progress. Of many becoming one. And, always, an unfinished mission to make the dreams of today the reality of tomorrow. 
ENTJ|A new day is dawning — and I am confident that these new leaders will capably lead our Caucus and the Congress. Read my full statement here 
ENTJ|In the 118th Congress, House Democrats will be led by a trio that reflects our beautiful diversity of our nation. Chair Jeffries, Assistant Speaker Clark and Vice Chair Aguilar know that, in our Caucus, diversity is our strength and unity is our power.
ENTJ|Yesterday, I said that the time has come for a new generation to lead our magnificent @HouseDemocrats. It is with pride, gratitude and confidence in their abilities that I salute @RepJeffries, @RepKClark , @RepPeteAguilar for being ready and willing to assume this responsibility.
ENTJ|Now, the hour has come for a new generation to lead the Democratic Caucus that I so deeply respect. I am grateful that so many are ready and willing to shoulder this awesome responsibility. 
ENTJ|Scripture teaches us that, for everything, there is a season – and a time for every purpose under heaven. As Speaker, it has been my privilege to play a part in forging extraordinary progress for the American people. 
ENTJ|Thank you all — and may God continue to bless the United States of America. 
ENTJ|Join me as I make a major announcement on the Floor of the House of Representatives. 
ENTJ|At least three critical states are still counting ballots. We are endlessly grateful to those who continue their patriotic work to ensure each vote is counted as cast. Read my full statement on the 2022 election here 
ENTJ|We salute our departing Members for their magnificent leadership, achieving landmark progress on health care, climate action, infrastructure, gun violence, veterans and more that can never be diminished.
ENTJ|House Democrats are thrilled to have so many terrific new and returning Members to the House, who will reinvigorate our Caucus with their energy, diversity and patriotism.
ENTJ|In the next Congress, @HouseDemocrats will continue to play a leading role supporting @POTUS’ agenda — with strong leverage over a scant Republican majority.
ENTJ|This year, @HouseDemocrats defied expectations with an excellent performance running their races with courage, optimism and determination.
ENTJ|As we celebrate the anniversary of this extraordinary achievement, Democrats remain fully committed to building on this progress, with lower costs, better-paying jobs and safer communities for all America’s families. Read my full statement here 
ENTJ|Thanks to the visionary leadership of @POTUS, and strengthened by the brilliance of @RepPeterDeFazio, America is back on track to have infrastructure that is the envy of the world – and can support a thriving 21st Century economy.
ENTJ|At the same time, this law advances @HouseDemocrats’ unyielding commitment to equity and justice getting lead out of drinking water, expanding broadband access in rural areas, and cleaning up legacy pollution in underserved communities.
ENTJ|Across the country, communities are already seeing the impacts of this landmark law. Shovels are in the ground right now, repairing roads and bridges, improving airports and waterways, and investing in passenger rail and public transit.
ENTJ|A year ago today, America took a giant leap forward to rebuild our nation while rebuilding our middle class. When @POTUS signed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we seized an opportunity to strengthen our nation’s crumbling infrastructure, create jobs and reconnect communities. 
ENTJ|Join Congressman-elect Rudy Yakym and me at the U.S. Capitol for a ceremonial swearing-in to fill the 2nd district seat of Indiana for the remainder of the 117th Congress. 
ENTJ|It is a blessing that so many new Members have come to serve with new ideas, new energy and new optimism for our nation. Their presence here is a testament to what our Founders intended the constant reinvigoration of the Congress. Welcome to the House of Representatives! 
ENTJ|The world has left incrementalism in the dust, with America leading the way, because we are serious about saving our planet For The Children. Check out a roundup of our Congressional delegation’s visit to #COP27 here. 
ENTJ|Our delegation returns to Washington re-energized to continue our fight for the ambitious and necessary climate action our world needs now. Nothing can deter @HouseDemocrats from our urgent mission to save the planet. 
ENTJ|It was a privilege to meet with NGO and civil society leaders to discuss human rights and the climate crisis. Many meeting participants highlighted the impacts of climate disaster in their communities and offered valuable insight that will help guide future action.

ENTJ|Our delegation salutes @POTUS – under his visionary leadership, America is accelerating our transition to a clean energy future and making progress on our commitment to future generations that we will pass on the planet in a responsible, sustainable way.
ENTJ|Today, our Congressional delegation concluded a productive visit to #COP27, where we delivered an unmistakable message America is all in to fight the climate crisis. 
ENTJ|Today, and every day, let us renew our resolve to build a future worthy of our veterans’ sacrifice. Americans share in a sacred obligation just as the military leaves no one behind on the battlefield, we must leave no veteran behind when they come home. 
ENTJ|It is with great pride that @HouseDemocrats also secured vital housing support for veterans through our American Rescue Plan, and we will continue fighting to strengthen life-saving mental health services with the House-passed STRONG Veterans Act.
ENTJ|This summer, with great respect for their sacrifice, the Congress passed and President Biden signed the PACT Act. This monumental achievement is protecting the health of those who fought to protect us – expanding access to care for as many as 3.5 million Servicemembers.
ENTJ|Each year, Veterans Day brings our nation together in gratitude for the patriotism, courage and selfless service of our military heroes. Honoring the service of these warriors has long been and must always be a unifying mission – a priority that transcends party and politics.
ENTJ|Together, President Biden and the Democratic Congress have enacted the largest climate investment in our nations history. Make no mistake America is all in! 
ENTJ|Today, our delegation met again with Foreign Minister , #COP27 President Sameh Shoukry , expressed our gratitude for his leadership in convening this extraordinary gathering. We discussed our work to extinguish the climate crisis, as well as key governance and security issues.

ENTJ|In the days ahead, our delegation will continue to reiterate that America continues to stand with our global partners ‘Together For Implementation’ as we work to build a cleaner, greener future for all of our children. Read my full statement here 
ENTJ|We received an update from @ClimateEnvoy on how the Biden Administration’s leadership is strengthening global partnerships and addressing the worlds climate ambitions. And we met with @EPAMichaelRegan to discuss his work advancing clean air and water for the world’s children. 
ENTJ|Members of our delegation also met with parliamentarians from @TheCVF. We heard firsthand how climate disasters are hitting hardest the most vulnerable communities and discussed the necessity of assisting developing nations in their efforts to address the climate crisis. 
ENTJ|It was my honor to participate in a moderated conversation with @ArshtRock Director Kathy McLeod. With @RepKCastor, we discussed how, under @POTUS, America is strategically investing in community resilience to help protect families amid the climate crisis. 
ENTJ|Today, we met with President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi, Foreign Minister and #COP27 President Sameh Shoukry and other senior Egyptian officials. We thanked them for their leadership in the fight to address the climate crisis and discussed our concerns regarding human rights. 
ENTJ|Our delegation traveled to #COP27 to make it clear that America is all in for climate action. This gathering comes just months after Democrats enacted the #InflationReductionAct, putting America on a path to meet our obligation to future generations and beat our Paris goals. 
ENTJ|Today, our delegation met with President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi of Egypt, the host nation of #COP27. We reaffirmed our strong security and economic partnership, and underscored the importance of human rights. 
ENTJ|.@ClimateEnvoys determined, skilled diplomacy is a vital asset to Americas leadership on climate. Thank you to Secretary Kerry for briefing our delegation on how the Biden Administration is strengthening global partnerships and raising the worlds climate ambitions. #COP27 
ENTJ|.@EPAMichaelRegan is a key leader in the fight to realize @POTUS vision for a clean energy future. It was a privilege to meet with this champion for environmental justice and discuss how America is creating the jobs of the future as we green our economy. #COP27 
ENTJ|The worlds most vulnerable nations are among the hardest hit by the climate crisis. Our delegation met with @DrEKMarfo and @TheCVF to discuss how Americans across the public and private sectors can partner with the world’s most vulnerable nations to power their clean future. 
ENTJ|Join @USRepKCastor and me for a moderated conversation on climate with @ArshtRock at #COP27. 
ENTJ|As the world stands #TogetherForImplementation, our delegation will meet with our partners – as well as civil society, youth and business leaders – to discuss what must be done to continue our progress to advance climate action and protect the planet. 
ENTJ|We’re all in, and since last year’s #COP26 in Glasgow, @POTUS Biden and the Democratic Congress have proudly enacted the most significant climate investment in U.S. history, putting America on track to slash carbon pollution by 40 percent this decade.
ENTJ|As Speaker, it is my privilege to lead a Congressional delegation to #COP27 in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. Faced with an accelerating climate crisis, Congress is proud to work with our partners around the world to advance a healthier, more sustainable and more equitable future.
ENTJ|Decisions are made by those who show up, and I want you to have a seat at the table. Voting is your right and your responsibility. Learn more about voting here 
ENTJ|Families around the world – including here at home – are feeling the sting of global inflation. Democrats are fighting to lower Americans cost of living slashing health care costs, easing energy bills , creating good-paying jobs. Republicans are fighting for their own power.
ENTJ|While Republicans want to send costs soaring and make working families pay the price, Democrats will always put People Over Politics lower costs, better-paying jobs and safer communities for all. Read my full statement on the October jobs report here 
ENTJ|Making them law will be a top priority for a Dem Majority next Congress. In stark contrast, MAGA Republicans’ extreme agenda would make inflation much worse plotting to repeal lower prescription drug costs, give tax breaks to the ultra-rich , slash Social Security and Medicare.
ENTJ|.@HouseDemocrats have gone further passing the Consumer Fuel Price Gouging Prevention Act, the Lower Food , Fuel Costs Act, and historic investments in paid leave, Child Tax Credit, child care, home health care, universal pre-K and affordable housing.
ENTJ|Democrats have enacted landmark laws to lower the cost of living for families lowering prescription drug costs and cutting health care premiums, while gas prices have come down.
ENTJ|This has been made possible by Dems’ bold action from our Rescue Plan to our Infrastructure Law to our CHIPS , Science Law to our Inflation Reduction Act. Shamefully, Republicans overwhelmingly voted against these laws – even rooting for a recession.
ENTJ|Now, with more than 10 million new jobs — including a record 700,000 new manufacturing jobs — Americans continue to get back to work and our economy continues to grow.
ENTJ|The October jobs numbers are the latest evidence that, under President Biden and the Democratic Congress, America continues to create jobs at a strong, steady, sustainable pace.
ENTJ|Paul is grateful to the 911 operator, emergency responders, trauma care team, ICU staff, and the entire @ZSFGCare medical staff for their excellent and compassionate life-saving treatment he received after the violent assault in our home. 
ENTJ|The Pelosi family is thankful for the beautiful outpouring of love, support and prayers from around the world. Paul remains under doctors’ care as he continues to progress on a long recovery process and convalescence. He is now home surrounded by his family who request privacy.
ENTJ|Thanks to @POTUS and Democrats in Congress, health coverage is more affordable and accessible than ever before. Starting today through December 15th, you can visit to find and enroll in a quality, affordable insurance plan for 2023. #GetCovered
ENTJ|Since the horrific attack on Paul early Friday, we have been deluged with thousands of messages conveying concern, prayers and warm wishes. We are most grateful. Thanks to the excellent team at @ZSFGCare, Paul is making steady progress on what will be a long recovery process.
ENTJ|Read my letter to my colleagues in the Congress here 
ENTJ|Please know that the prayers and warm wishes from so many are a comfort to our family and are helping Paul make progress with his recovery. We are grateful for the quick response of law enforcement and emergency services, and for the life-saving medical care he is receiving.
ENTJ|This week, I was proud to represent the Congress at the First Parliamentary Summit of the International @CrimeaPlatform to reiterate our commitment to stand with Ukraine until victory is won. 
ENTJ|Through that vital work, we strive to console devastated loved ones and pay tribute to the beautiful souls murdered four years ago. May their memories be a blessing. 
ENTJ|Today, and every day, let us renew our resolve to disarm the forces of hate, build safer communities for our children and finally toss antisemitism into the dustbin of history.
ENTJ|Today’s anniversary highlights our collective obligation to condemn and reject antisemitism in all its forms – from the vile conspiracies amplified by a celebrity to the violent extremism inflamed by the far right.
ENTJ|We have a responsibility to combat the scourge of antisemitism – to ensure every American can live free from bigoted speech and hate-fueled violence. Yet as we mark this dark day, words, symbols and acts of hate continue to torment Jews and other communities across the country.
ENTJ|As Americans mark 4 years since the horrendous attack on Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life Synagogue, the deadliest antisemitic massacre in American history, my colleagues and I join our nation’s Jewish community in mourning 11 peaceful worshippers stolen away by a monstrous act of hate.
ENTJ|Join @RepHuffman, community leaders, partners , me in San Francisco for the @GoldenGateNPS 50th Anniversary to celebrate this local treasure , global icon where families can relax, children can learn , millions can witness the natural beauty of our region. 
ENTJ|It was an honor to welcome President @IsaacHerzog to the United States Capitol yesterday — reaffirming Congress’ long-standing, bipartisan and bicameral support for the U.S.-Israel bond. 
ENTJ|This week’s observance of 4 years since the deadly Tree of Life Synagogue shooting highlights that we must always condemn antisemitism and bigotry here and around the world — including from celebrities like Kanye West. Being a celebrity is not a license to incite violence.
ENTJ|Join His Excellency @IsaacHerzog, President of the State of Israel, and me at the United States Capitol ahead of a bilateral leadership meeting. 
ENTJ|Congressman @GerryConnolly and I return to Washington further informed about Ukraine’s security, economic and humanitarian needs, as the Congress prepares to deliver another round of assistance to Ukraine in the upcoming omnibus legislation. 
ENTJ|It was a privilege to hold a bilateral meeting with @AndreasOstgote of Sweden , @AnttiRinnepj of Finland legislative leaders of NATO’s newest members. Our discussions focused on the importance of maintaining the ironclad unity of the transatlantic alliance as we defend freedom.
ENTJ|The remarks by Congressman @GerryConnolly, President of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, on the central role of our transatlantic alliance in supporting Ukraine’s fight for freedom and countering Russian aggression were an especially valuable contribution to the conversation.

ENTJ|The international community’s solidarity has been vital to Ukraine’s fight – and it will be even more so, as winter approaches. As I said to my colleagues at the Summit let us all have the courage of the Ukrainian people as we ensure that the flame of liberty burns bright. 
ENTJ|Under President Biden, America has delivered on our promise to support the Ukrainian people securing critical assistance and holding Russia accountable. We have acted on a bipartisan basis – because what is at stake in Ukraine is Democracy itself. 
ENTJ|Today, it was my high honor to address the First Parliamentary Summit of @CrimeaPlatform, at the invitation of Speaker @RStefanchuk. My message was simple America and our allies pledged to stand with Ukraine until victory is won – and that is what we will do. 
ENTJ|With Finland , Sweden’s NATO accession, the strongest security alliance in history grows even stronger. Today, I met with Swedish Speaker @AndreasOstgote and Finnish First Deputy Speaker @AnttiRinnepj to discuss our vital work to defend freedom – in Europe and around the globe.

ENTJ|As Putin escalates his appalling atrocities against civilians, we reaffirm this truth Crimea is Ukraine, Russia’s unlawful occupation of all Ukrainian territory must end, and Russia must be held accountable for its crimes. Read my full statement here 
ENTJ|It was my privilege to meet with human rights activists from Crimea, who shared their harrowing , heartbreaking stories of torture, imprisonment , abductions at Russia’s hands. We must strengthen Ukraine’s capacity in this fight, as Iranian drones take a deadly toll on civilians.
ENTJ|It was an honor to meet with PM @AndrejPlenkovic and Speaker Gordan Jandroković. Croatia is a valued American ally and a key partner in peace and stability in Europe, including in energy, security and our global response to Russia’s aggression against Ukraine.
ENTJ|Today, thanks to @ZelenskyyUa , @RStefanchuk, it was a privilege to attend the First Parliamentary Summit of the International @CrimeaPlatform in Croatia. It is a tribute to the broad , urgent global support for Ukraine that more than 50 nations are participating in this summit. 
ENTJ|It was an honor to meet with Ukrainian Speaker @RStefanchuk , express America’s admiration for the heroes of Ukraine. We reaffirmed that America , our allies stand with the Ukrainian people – in Crimea, in other illegally annexed areas, across the country – until victory is won. 
ENTJ|The U.S.-German alliance is central to supporting Ukraine, as well as advancing global peace, security and stability. Meeting with Bundestag President @BaerbelBas, I thanked her for hosting the G7 Speakers’ Meeting last month and discussed our ongoing work to defend democracy.

ENTJ|It was a privilege to meet with Speaker of the Croatian Parliament Gordan Jandroković, whose government is hosting the First Parliamentary Summit of the International Crimea Platform. In our meeting, we reaffirmed our shared commitment to stand with Ukraine until victory is won.

ENTJ|Working with speed, strength and unity, America and our allies have imposed devastating consequences on Russia and delivered game-changing aid to Ukraine. Our ironclad solidarity with the heroes of Ukraine has been decisive, and it will be even more crucial as winter approaches.
ENTJ|Russia is waging an unprovoked, all-out assault on Ukraine from the occupation of Crimea to attempts to illegally annex additional Ukrainian territory to escalating targeting of civilians. Thats why America , our allies are reaffirming our pledge to support the Ukrainian people
ENTJ|As Speaker, it’s my privilege to represent the United States at the First Parliamentary Summit of the International Crimea Platform. Alongside European allies and global partners, we will deliver an unmistakable statement of our solidarity with Ukraine in its fight for freedom.
ENTJ|Today, I joined @MargBrennan on @FaceTheNation to discuss the work that @HouseDemocrats are doing to lower costs for Americas working families. Every step of the way, @HouseGOP has opposed our cost-cutting legislation — because they have no plan to lower the cost of living. 
ENTJ|We know more must be done to lower the cost of living for America’s working families. We will continue our fight to put #PeopleOverPolitics — with lower costs, better-paying jobs , safer communities. Read more on @HouseDemocrats actions on inflation here 
ENTJ|The #CHIPSandScienceAct reinvigorates American semiconductor manufacturing, strengthens supply chains and invests in innovation. 187 House Republicans voted No on this law.
ENTJ|The Infrastructure Law puts Americans back to work rebuilding our roads, bridges, ports and water systems — which will cut commute times, save families on car repairs and bring down transit costs. 200 House Republicans voted No on this law.
ENTJ|The #AmericanRescuePlan lowered health care costs, extended needed unemployment benefits and delivered a vital lifeline in the Child Tax Credit. Again, every single Republican voted No on this important law.
ENTJ|The #InflationReductionAct slashes the cost of prescription drugs, locks in lower health care premiums, cuts energy bills and reduces the deficit — while making the wealthiest few and big corporations pay their fair share. Every single Republican voted No on this law.
ENTJ|Democrats have been laser-focused on lowering the cost of living for America’s working families. @POTUS , @HouseDemocrats have sparked a record-setting jobs recovery, and at the same time, we have enacted landmark laws to make progress toward lowering the cost of living.
ENTJ|Democrats are creating jobs, cutting the deficit and making corporations pay their fair share. In contrast, Republicans want to explode the deficit with massive tax cuts for the rich and big corporations, while slashing Social Security and Medicare.
ENTJ|Every American deserves to live in a safe community where they can thrive. That’s why @HouseDemocrats enacted an historic gun violence prevention law — and voted to give law enforcement the tools to prevent crime while advancing strong training and accountability measures.
ENTJ|American Rescue Plan. Infrastructure Law. CHIPS , Science. Inflation Reduction Act. With these landmark laws, @HouseDemocrats have powered America’s record-setting job creation 9.4 million since @POTUS took office. @HouseGOP overwhelmingly voted against these laws.
ENTJ|Anna May Wong was a dazzling, trailblazing talent on the silver screen , a courageous advocate for representation in cinema — inspiring generations of AAPI actors. It’s fitting her likeness will grace our quarter beside an all-American creed E Pluribus Unum, from many, one.
ENTJ|.@HouseDemocrats are laser focused on widening the path to prosperity for America’s families lowering costs and creating better-paying jobs. Meanwhile, @HouseGOP members are focused on their extreme MAGA agenda to slash Social Security and Medicare. The contrast is clear.
ENTJ|Republicans continue to show us their plans to cut Medicare and Social Security, take away a womans right to choose and repeal lower prescription drug costs. Meanwhile, @HouseDemocrats have passed legislation to lower costs for families and take bold action on climate change. 
ENTJ|With the #InflationReductionAct, @HouseDemocrats have taken on the special interests lowering drug prices, slashing health insurance premiums and cutting energy bills For The People. Every Member of @HouseGOP voted against it.
ENTJ|.@HouseGOP won’t stop at banning abortion in all 50 states. As they double down on their extreme MAGA Agenda, they want to lock up doctors for 5 years and even end the right to birth control. This is an assault on health, freedom and financial security.
ENTJ|Join local education and nutrition experts and me at the Florence Fang Community Farm for a roundtable on food sovereignty, where we will discuss how to ensure that communities in the Bayview can grow their own healthy food supply. 
ENTJ|.@HouseGOP continues to double down on a dangerous extreme MAGA agenda to criminalize women’s health care, slash seniors’ Medicare and attack our free and fair elections. While Republicans continue to push policies For Their Power, @HouseDemocrats are #ForThePeople.
ENTJ|Republicans continue their attacks on our democracy making it harder to vote, while helping extreme MAGA politicians invent a basis to overturn the results of elections they don’t like. Meanwhile, @HouseDemocrats will always defend democracy #ForThePeople.
ENTJ|Social Security and Medicare are as important now for America’s seniors as ever. Yet extreme MAGA Republicans are doubling down on their long-held goal of gutting these vital initiatives — plotting to slash benefits and raise costs for seniors.
ENTJ|The average retiree benefit will increase by $146 per month next year, putting more money in American seniors’ pockets and protecting them from rising costs. Democrats will continue our work to protect Social Security and Medicare. #PeopleOverPolitics 
ENTJ|Calling all San Francisco middle and high school students interested in exploring STEM and computer science the deadline for the Congressional App Challenge is November 1st! Find out more at 
ENTJ|While extreme MAGA politicians play politics with people’s lives, Democrats’ commitment to Social Security, to Medicare and to our seniors is unshakable – because we always put #PeopleOverPolitics. 
ENTJ|Republicans are pledging to repeal the lower drug costs and 158 House Republicans have already endorsed an extreme MAGA plan to privatize Social Security, raise the retirement age and end Medicare as we know it.
ENTJ|Yet with Social Security , Medicare as essential as ever, extreme MAGA Republicans are openly plotting new schemes to slash seniors’ benefits , raise their costs – including by threatening to cause an economic catastrophe by holding the debt limit hostage for their toxic agenda.
ENTJ|The increase in Social Security benefits, together with the historic action that Democrats have delivered to lower seniors’ prescription drug costs with the Inflation Reduction Act, shows the vital role Medicare and Social Security provide to protect seniors from rising costs.
ENTJ|This year’s cost-of-living boost in benefits is an important reminder that Social Security is the bedrock of financial security for America’s seniors in challenging times. Yet extreme MAGA Republicans are doubling down on slashing Social Security , Medicare.
ENTJ|I proudly fought alongside @LondonBreed and @SFDPH to keep Laguna Honda open and pause patient transfers — as the hospital redoubles efforts to implement needed operational and institutional changes to come into full compliance.
ENTJ|.@SFCityAttorney , @CMSGov announced a settlement that will allow Laguna Honda Hospital to remain open so its dedicated staff can care for their patients. This agreement provides a clear path to recertification for this pillar of health , well-being for San Francisco families.
ENTJ|By opposing our Inflation Reduction Act, @HouseGOP voted against lower prescription drug prices, against lower health insurance premiums and against lower energy bills. But @HouseDemocrats triumphed to put #PeopleOverPolitics.
ENTJ|Lea mi artículo en @LaOpinionLA, sobre lo que los @HouseDemocrats están haciendo para garantizar que las familias latinas, y todas las familias estadounidenses, puedan salir adelante. 
ENTJ|During #HispanicHeritageMonth, we celebrate our vibrant, diverse, entrepreneurial Latino communities. Read my op-ed in @LaOpinionLA, where I share how @HouseDemocrats are working to ensure that Latino families – and all of America’s families – can thrive. 
ENTJ|While extreme MAGA Republicans mobilize around a dangerous agenda of gutting Medicare and raising health costs on families, Democrats will never relent in our fight to put People Over Politics – because we know that health care is a right, not a privilege. 
ENTJ|But now, extreme MAGA Republicans want to repeal these lower costs and make health care more expensive for seniors and families.
ENTJ|For seniors, the Inflation Reduction Act dramatically lowered prescription drug costs capping out-of-pocket expenses at $2,000, empowering Medicare to negotiate for lower prices and banning predatory price hikes faster than inflation.
ENTJ|In our American Rescue Plan, we slashed ACA premiums for working families – and then locked in those savings with our Inflation Reduction Act.
ENTJ|This means that, under President Biden and a Democratic Congress, 14 million Americans have gained the dignity and security of lower health care costs. This is the latest step in Democrats’ relentless fight to lower health costs.
ENTJ|Today, the Treasury Department finalizes the fix so that, when Open Enrollment begins on November 1st, nearly a million more Americans will see lower premiums or gain affordable coverage.
ENTJ|In April, @POTUS took a powerful step to make health care more affordable and accessible by ending the family glitch in the Affordable Care Act — strengthening the law so that it functions as Congress intended.
ENTJ|On #NationalComingOutDay, we celebrate the courage of those who overcame hardship to live with pride and authenticity — no matter who you are or whom you love. Democrats are proud to stand with our LGBTQ communities, as we forge a future where all are seen and heard. 
ENTJ|As a part of the GOP campaign to gut the pillars of seniors’ economic security, 158 @HouseGOP members have called for raising the retirement age to 70 , slashing , privatizing Social Security. @HouseDemocrats are lowering costs for our seniors and putting #PeopleOverPolitics.
ENTJ|From criminalizing abortion to dismantling Medicare to attacking democracy, @HouseGOP’s agenda is dangerous and extreme. Meanwhile, @HouseDemocrats are working #ForThePeople — lowering costs, creating better paying jobs and safer communities.
ENTJ|Join me @SFMFoodBank for a ribbon-cutting ceremony for a facility expansion to distribute 75 million pounds of food annually and serve 200,000 people weekly, which I was proud to support with $1 million in Community Project Funding for an expanded cooler. 
ENTJ|Making more goods here in America, with American workers. That’s how @HouseDemocrats are creating better-paying jobs. Meanwhile, @HouseGOP is working to criminalize abortion, raise drug prices and undermine our democracy. The contrast in priorities is clear.
ENTJ|Make no mistake Republicans want to raise costs on the backs of America’s working families. In sharp contrast, @HouseDemocrats are fighting to put #PeopleOverPolitics lower costs, better-paying jobs and safer communities for all of America’s families. 
ENTJ|At the same time, while Democrats are lowering kitchen table costs for families with our #InflationReductionAct, @HouseGOP has put forth an extreme MAGA agenda that would raise prescription drug prices, slash Social Security and Medicare, and diminish our economy.
ENTJ|This progress was powered by Democrats’ economic agenda from our Rescue Plan to our Infrastructure Law to our CHIPS and Science Act. But Republicans overwhelmingly opposed these laws — and the historic job creation they have sparked.
ENTJ|Today’s jobs numbers offer further proof that America remains on a path of strong, sustainable job growth. Under @POTUS Biden and a Democratic Congress, our nation has seen the strongest jobs recovery in modern times.
ENTJ|Our proud Democratic Majority will never relent in fighting for these reforms, and more, as we work to advance justice for all. Read my full statement on President Biden’s historic marijuana reform here 
ENTJ|.@HouseDemocrats applaud these bold actions, which build on the progress we forged in passing our Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act. This legislation decriminalizes marijuana at the federal level and empowers all to participate in the cannabis industry.
ENTJ|Failed federal drug policies — which have specifically targeted communities of color — have torn apart too many families. By pardoning those arrested for simple marijuana possession, and encouraging governors to follow suit, the President is advancing racial and economic justice.
ENTJ|This is a day of hope and healing, as @POTUS takes historic steps to reform America’s approach to marijuana. These transformative actions are the latest manifestation of Democrats’ unyielding commitment to justice, especially for those unfairly harmed by cannabis criminalization.
ENTJ|We know that @HouseGOP wants to slash Medicare and Social Security and raise drug prices — because they’ve told us. 158 House Republicans have called for privatizing Social Security and ending Medicare as we know it as part of this year’s Republican Study Committee budget.
ENTJ|Senate Republicans must join us to immediately pass this urgent, necessary, House-passed legislation and send it straight to President Biden’s desk. Read my full statement 
ENTJ|Shamefully, extreme MAGA Republicans in the Senate have blocked this bill, playing political games with families’ futures while embracing an extreme agenda of anti-immigrant cruelty.
ENTJ|That’s why @HouseDemocrats have twice passed the Dream and Promise Act to finally offer Dreamers a permanent pathway to citizenship, while fixing our broken immigration system through comprehensive reform.
ENTJ|.@POTUS is to be commended for his proactive action in August to strengthen the DACA initiative against extreme MAGA Republican attacks. More must be done to offer the permanent stability and security that millions of Dreamers and their families deserves.
ENTJ|Today’s appellate court ruling offers a measure of temporary relief for our Dreamers, who are a pride and constant reinvigoration of our nation.
ENTJ|Republicans only work for their power voting against lowering costs for families and our seniors. While they propose their extreme, unpopular MAGA agenda, @HouseDemocrats are working #ForThePeople to lower costs, create better-paying jobs and build safer communities.
ENTJ|Last night, I joined the @ColbertLateShow and spoke about @POTUS Bidens bold agenda for women all across the country. 
ENTJ|Instead of joining @HouseDemocrats to lower costs, create better-paying jobs , build safer communities, @HouseGOP is proposing an extreme MAGA agenda to criminalize women’s health care, slash seniors’ Medicare , attack elections. Their agenda is too dangerous for our families.
ENTJ|To Jewish communities here at home and around the world, may #YomKippur bring a day of meaningful prayer and an easy fast. 
ENTJ|Always a pleasure to catch up with @StephenAtHome and discuss @HouseDemocrats’ fight to put #PeopleOverPolitics. Be sure to tune into the @colbertlateshow tonight! 
ENTJ|Just as the military leaves no soldier behind on the battlefield, we must leave no veteran behind when they come home. By ensuring 3.5 million more veterans get the benefits they are due, we take another step toward to honor this sacred promise to care for our heroes in uniform.
ENTJ|Today, thanks to our landmark PACT Act, many more veterans who were exposed to deadly toxins while serving their country can now enroll in VA health care! To see if youre eligible, visit 
ENTJ|.@HouseGOP’s extreme Commitment To MAGA agenda vows to send seniors’ prescription drug prices skyrocketing – just to pad Big Pharmas profits. @HouseDemocrats have slashed drug prices – and we’ll keep fighting to lower costs for America’s families, putting #PeopleOverPolitics.
ENTJ|We continue to look to his leadership for guidance today as we defend democracy against autocracy, especially in Ukraine. This magnificent statue will serve as a constant symbol of our commitment to democracy. 
ENTJ|President Truman knew that a threat to democracy anywhere was a threat to democracy everywhere. Thats why he forged strong alliances with friends of freedom across the globe, especially with the formation of NATO.
ENTJ|As Speaker of the House, it was a privilege to celebrate one of our nations finest presidents, President Harry Truman and unveil his statue in Statuary Hall of the United States Capitol. 
ENTJ|Join me live at the U.S. Capitol for my weekly press conference. 
ENTJ|Yesterday, it was my privilege to welcome the leaders of the Pacific Island nations and territories to the U.S. Capitol for a first-ever Summit to strengthen our vital ties and discuss our shared commitment to advancing a free, open and prosperous Indo-Pacific. 
ENTJ|Join Congressional Leadership, Members of the Missouri Congressional Delegation, Chairman Clifton Truman Daniel of @TrumanLibInst , me in the U.S. Capitol for the Congressional statue dedication , unveiling ceremony in honor of President Harry S. Truman. 
ENTJ|Gracias a @GavinNewsom por apoyar a nuestros trabajadores y aprobar la ley #AB2183. Y felicidades a @UFWupdates. A través de la solidaridad y la defensa incesante, ustedes ganaron mejores salarios, condiciones de trabajo más seguras y un futuro más justo. #SíSePuede!

ENTJ|Thank you to @GavinNewsom for supporting our workers and signing #AB2183 into law. And congratulations to the members of @UFWupdates. Through solidarity and relentless advocacy, you won better wages, safer working conditions and a more just future. #SíSePuede!
ENTJ|This is an historic and joyous victory for the California farm workers who keep us fed!
ENTJ|Every woman, everywhere has the right to health freedom. But the extreme MAGA @HouseGOP has pledged to ban abortion in all 50 states and sentence doctors for 5 years in prison. @HouseDemocrats will always defend women’s health care, because we put #PeopleOverPolitics.
ENTJ|As we monitor the aftermath in the coming days, the House stands ready to help communities recover and rebuild.
ENTJ|I join the American people in praying for the millions of Floridians bracing for #HurricaneIan — including the heroic first responders keeping families safe on the ground.
ENTJ|We look forward to drawing on the findings of today’s Conference as we continue working to forge that future for all of America’s children. 
ENTJ|Guided by @RepMcGovern’s leadership of the House Hunger Caucus, we have proudly stood with the grassroots activists working to end hunger once and for all. @HouseDemocrats will never relent in our fight to build a future free from hunger, food insecurity , diet-related disease.
ENTJ|President Kennedy once told the World Food Congress ‘We have the capacity to eliminate hunger from the face of the earth in our lifetime. We need only the will.’
ENTJ|The injustice of children going to bed hungry is a moral outrage – one that motivated myself and many in our House Democratic Caucus to seek public office.
ENTJ|With this year’s White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition and Health, @POTUS is mobilizing renewed, nationwide action against the hunger crisis – including more than $8 billion in private- and public-sector commitments.
ENTJ|Here’s what @HouseGOP’s new Extreme MAGA Agenda means for America’s families - abortion criminalized in all 50 states - slashes Medicare , higher drug prices - attacks on free , fair elections This radical, dangerous platform is way out of step with Americans’ priorities.
ENTJ|Lower costs. Better-paying jobs. Safer communities. That’s what @HouseDemocrats mean by putting #PeopleOverPolitics. Abortion bans. Higher drug prices. Weakened democracy. Thats what @HouseGOP promises with their #CommitmentToMAGA Agenda. The contrast in priorities is clear.
ENTJ|As MAGA Republicans continue their attacks on womens reproductive health, @HouseDemocrats passed the Right to Contraception Act to ensure contraception remains legal , accessible. On #WorldContraceptionDay, Democrats remain committed to fighting for freedom , basic health care.
ENTJ|Nationwide abortion ban. Higher drug prices. Attacks on Democracy. This is what @HouseGOP’s extreme #CommitmentToMAGA agenda means for America’s families. But @HouseDemocrats are fighting for lower costs, better-paying jobs , safer communities – putting #PeopleOverPolitics.
ENTJ|Read my full statement on Rosh Hashanah here 
ENTJ|The scourge of antisemitism continues to plague Jewish communities, while outrageous economic and racial injustices still tarnish the soul of America. This Rosh Hashanah, let us renew our resolve to stamp out hate, advance justice and build a future worthy of our children.
ENTJ|For millions, this year has brought the joy of long-delayed family gatherings and the hope of many more to come. But as families around the globe continue to face unthinkable hardship, our responsibility to help repair the world remains as urgent as ever.
ENTJ|May these Days of Awe provide time to rejoice alongside loved ones reflecting on the challenges of the past year, celebrating its blessings and preparing for all that that lies ahead in 5783.
ENTJ|On behalf of the United States Congress, shana tovah u’metukah! As families across the country prepare to celebrate Rosh Hashanah, the Congress joins Americans in wishing our Jewish communities a healthy, sweet new year. 
ENTJ|With their new agenda, @HouseGOP has made a whole-hearted #CommitmentToMAGA. Their extremist proposals – criminalizing women’s health care, slashing Medicare, undermining Democracy – are too dangerous for America’s families. In contrast, @HouseDemocrats put #PeopleOverPolitics.
ENTJ|If @HouseGOP gets its way, they’ll repeal these benefits and raise prices for millions of Americans on Medicare. This twisted logic is just another reason the House Republican extreme MAGA platform is too dangerous for Americas seniors and families.
ENTJ|In a major victory over Big Pharma, Democrats’ new law ✅Finally empowers Medicare to negotiate for lower drug prices ✅ Caps seniors’ out-of-pocket drug costs at $2000 a year and insulin at $35 a month ✅ Secures free vaccines for seniors ✅ Prevents predatory price hikes
ENTJ|.@HouseDemocrats #InflationReductionAct delivers historic action to lower prescription drug prices for America’s seniors. But @HouseGOP’s Extreme MAGA Agenda will repeal those lower costs – hiking prices on seniors to give billions back to Big Pharma. 
ENTJ|The contrast is crystal clear Democrats are For The People, while Republicans are For Their Power. The American people will Remember in November that House Republicans’ extreme MAGA agenda is far too dangerous — for our families and for our Democracy. 
ENTJ|But this extreme MAGA agenda is way out of step with Americans’ priorities, who align with Democrats’ vision of putting #PeopleOverPolitics with lower costs, better-paying jobs and safer communities.
ENTJ|This alarming new extreme MAGA platform threatens to criminalize women’s health care, slash seniors’ Medicare and raise prescription drug prices, and attack our free and fair elections.
ENTJ|Today’s rollout is the latest evidence of House Republicans’ whole-hearted Commitment to MAGA going all-in on an extremist agenda designed to greatly diminish Americans’ health, freedom and security.
ENTJ|.@HouseDemocrats know every American deserves to live in a safe community – where they , their family can thrive. This public safety package is the latest manifestation of our commitment to putting #PeopleOverPolitics , building safer communities for all. 
ENTJ|We passed 3 bills to save lives @RepKatiePorters sends unarmed mental health professionals for mental health crises, @RepHorsfords invests in effective community violence intervention , @RepValDemings ensures police can solve violent crimes , advances justice for victims.
ENTJ|Led by @RepJoshG , @RepBeatty the #InvestToProtectAct funds our police , includes training for de-escalation , nonlethal force, substance use disorders response, , supporting survivors of domestic violence. This legislation is a victory for safety , accountability for all.
ENTJ|Today is a day of important progress on one of @HouseDemocrats’ top priorities building safer communities. The #InvestToProtectAct we passed today – rooted in Democrats’ values of safety , justice – takes a strong step to prevent crime, save lives , advance justice.
ENTJ|The courageous voices of the Iranian people are being heard around the world. The United States Congress joins them in mourning the horrific death of Mahsa Amini. Tehran must end its violent, systematic campaign of abuse against women and girls. #مهساامینی

ENTJ|Today, I spoke on the House Floor on the Presidential Election Reform Act, bipartisan and historic legislative action to safeguard the integrity of future presidential elections, stand up for the rule of law and pass on a vibrant Democracy for generations to come.

ENTJ|Congress is committed to ensuring that the truth of the genocide is never erased – which is why, in 2019, we passed legislation to formally acknowledge the Armenian Genocide, which @POTUS Biden echoed with his official recognition last year.
ENTJ|Members of the @ArmenianCaucus Chairs @FrankPallone, @RepAnnaEshoo, and @RepSpeier, and I began our visit by laying a wreath at the Tsitsernakaberd Armenian Genocide Memorial. There, we prayed for the 1.5 million Armenian men, women, and children murdered in the genocide.

ENTJ|During this difficult time, we must have hope. We can find hope in the story of Armenia, which is one of resilience and strength. We can find hope through the arts, and as the poet Paruyr Sevak wrote the flame never went off, but through long centuries kept on burning. 
ENTJ|After my speech, our delegation has the opportunity to speak with civil society leaders at a roundtable. They shared their experiences and we discussed the need to ensure that all can live free from violence , conflict. 
ENTJ|Today, I delivered remarks in Yerevan at the Cafesjian Center for the Arts to make it clear that America stands with Armenia. In the ongoing battle against autocracy around the world, we will always support democracy and freedom. 
ENTJ|I also expressed the condemnation of the Congress for Azerbaijans attack , reaffirmed the US’ commitment to a negotiated, comprehensive, and sustainable settlement to all conflicts related to Nagorno Karabakh that will lead to a future of peace and stability.

ENTJ|This afternoon, our delegation met with Speaker @AlenSimonyan to reiterate Congresss commitment to strengthening the U.S.-Armenian relationship and convey Americas support for Armenia following Azerbaijan’s assault on its territory. 
ENTJ|Last year, President Biden made history by becoming the first US President to formally recognize the genocide, following the Houses 2019 passage of H.Res.296 to do so. We must never allow the truth of the genocide to be erased, especially as atrocities are perpetrated today. 
ENTJ|The Congress is committed to always honoring our collective responsibility to uphold the memory of the dead, affirm the history of this tragedy, and ensure such a horror can never again happen. 
ENTJ|Today, our delegation was deeply honored to join @AlenSimonyan to lay a wreath at Tsitsernakaberd Armenian Genocide Memorial and pray for the 1.5 million Armenian men, women, and children murdered in the genocide.

ENTJ|At the @G7, it was an honor to meet with Chancellor @OlafScholz, a steadfast partner for peace and stability during this challenging moment for Democracy. His committed leadership to support Ukraine with security and humanitarian support and punish Russia has been essential. 
ENTJ|In my remarks, I recalled the message of Czechoslovakian President Vaclav Havel in his address to Congress in 1990. He said that Democracy is an horizon even as we approach it, there is always more work to be done. At the @G7, we are renewing our pledge to this vital mission.
ENTJ|The energy and enthusiasm of young people on climate action, equality , justice, and reproductive freedom offer hope for our future. My colleagues and I emphasized the importance of better connecting young people with our politics and governance through civic education.

ENTJ|It is my privilege to represent the United States at this year’s @G7 Speakers’ Meeting in Berlin. At the heart of our bilateral and multilateral discussions will be Russia’s unlawful, unjustified war against Ukraine – and autocratic threats worldwide.
ENTJ|@POTUS @SecMartyWalsh I also want to commend the representatives of the labor unions who wouldn’t leave the table without achieving justice for their workers. Read my full statement on the Tentative Railway Labor Agreement here

ENTJ|In sharp contrast, Democrats are fighting to put #PeopleOverPolitics – and we will never relent until we restore the rights of Roe as the law of the land. 
ENTJ|With Roe now out of their way, extreme MAGA Republicans are gleefully charging ahead with their deadly crusade to punish and control women’s health decisions.
ENTJ|Meanwhile, House Republicans have overwhelmingly backed criminalizing abortion nationwide, rejecting women’s right to travel for health care and even eliminating the right to birth control.
ENTJ|Instead of fighting actual crime, Republicans would drag doctors off to prison, while forcing ER physicians to focus on the threat of prosecution instead of the emergency medical care owed their patients.
ENTJ|We are already seeing the agonizing reality of the radical bans enacted by radical right-wing state legislatures – and extreme MAGA Republicans in Congress clearly want to inflict this same suffering on every woman in every state.
ENTJ|Make no mistake if Republicans get the chance, they will work to pass laws even more draconian than this bill – just like the bans they have enacted in states like Texas, Mississippi and Oklahoma.
ENTJ|The nationwide abortion ban proposal put forth today is the latest, clearest signal of extreme MAGA Republicans intent to criminalize women’s health freedom in all 50 states and arrest doctors for providing basic care.
ENTJ|As Americans mark today’s anniversary, let us honor both the memory of those stolen away by senseless violence and the profound courage of survivors across the country. Read my full statement on the 28th anniversary of the Violence Against Women Act here 
ENTJ|This year, the Congress took another step forward – passing the long-overdue Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act. This legislation bolsters investments in violence prevention, strengthens services for survivors and empowers Tribal courts to prosecute non-Native abusers.
ENTJ|In the years since it was signed into law, @HouseDemocrats have proudly fought to strengthen and expand this landmark legislation – determined to stamp out an epidemic of violence that still affects one in three women.
ENTJ|For 28 years, the Violence Against Women Act has stood as a pillar of justice and safety. Written, introduced and championed by @POTUS Biden in the Senate three decades ago, VAWA remains an invaluable tool in our nation’s fight against the horrors of domestic violence. 
ENTJ|It is outrageous that, six decades after Griswold was decided, women must again fight against a radical Republican Party just to use birth control. @HouseDemocrats passed our Right to Contraception Act to protect this freedom – but @HouseGOP overwhelmingly voted NO.
ENTJ|Let us renew our resolve to build a future worthy of their memory abundant in peace, free of hate and safer for all. Read my full statement here 
ENTJ|While we pray that time may ease the grief and pain inflicted two decades ago, it cannot diminish our love for those taken from us or our debt to those heroes who gave their lives to save others.
ENTJ|Recognizing our responsibility to those who donned a uniform in the wake of September 11th, @POTUS signed the Honoring our PACT Act last month – expanding access to life-saving care for millions of veterans across the country.
ENTJ|Congress has worked to honor those whose bravery lit our way through one of the darkest moments in American history securing vital support for 9/11 heroes and their families with the James Zadroga 9/11 Health , Compensation Act and the Never Forget the Heroes Act.
ENTJ|While images of smoke and rubble are forever etched into our collective memory, so too is evidence of America’s extraordinary resilience first responders racing toward scenes of destruction, communities rallying together and a generation of patriots stepping forward to serve.
ENTJ|On this morning 21 years ago, unfathomable acts of terror wreaked destruction on U.S. soil shattering Americans’ sense of security and forever changing our nation. As we remember the 3,000 precious souls stolen away from us, we pray for the families left behind.
ENTJ|Republicans want to gut Social Security and Medicare – threatening seniors health and financial security. Democrats will never relent in defending the right to a secure retirement. With our #InflationReductionAct, we are proudly bringing down health costs for our seniors.
ENTJ|Inspired by the Bay Area’s progress, Congress delivered game-changing infrastructure investments nationwide. Transportation is the #1 source of carbon pollution. Our Infrastructure Law is creating jobs , rebuilding communities — essential to our fight against the #climatecrisis. 
ENTJ|With the Central Subway in Chinatown, San Francisco maintains its status as a smart, sustainable, spectacular model for the nation. This will be a deeply needed boon for a community hit hard by the pandemic – and racist conspiracy theories that sadly ensued. 
ENTJ|This week, I joined @SecretaryPete, Mayor @LondonBreed and local transportation and community leaders to celebrate the new Central Subway Muni Metro line running through Chinatown. Our ride and tour was a thrilling preview of what this project brings to the Bay Area. 
ENTJ|Thanks to @HouseDemocrats, health care is more affordable and accessible than ever. Our Rescue Plan dramatically lowered ACA premiums for 13 million Americans. And now, our #InflationReductionAct is locking in those lower costs – saving a family of four up to $2,800 per year.
ENTJ|Join @SecretaryPete, @LondonBreed, local transportation and community leaders and me at the new Central Subway @SFMTAMuni Metro Line as we discuss the progress of the project and the importance of investing in clean, safe, affordable public transit. 
ENTJ|May it be a comfort to her children, grandchildren, great grandchildren and the entire Royal Family that Americans join them in prayer at this sad time. 
ENTJ|Personally, it was an honor to be on the Floor of the House during her historic address to the Congress in 1991 and to welcome her as Speaker on her important visit to the United States in 2007, which deepened the special relationship between our nations.
ENTJ|Her extraordinary life and leadership will continue to inspire young women and girls in public service, now and for generations to come.
ENTJ|She took an important step toward hope and healing in 2011, when she made history as the first British monarch to visit Ireland in a century. Under history’s brightest spotlight, Queen Elizabeth offered a masterclass in grace and strength, power and poise.
ENTJ|Her Majesty capably shepherded the United Kingdom through great turbulence and transition. As the Head of the Commonwealth, she helped advance a new global order of security, prosperity and peace.
ENTJ|On behalf of the United States Congress, I extend our deepest and most sincere condolences to the Royal Family during this sad time. Queen Elizabeth embodied the highest spirit of civic duty earning the reverence of her people and the respect of the world.
ENTJ|Today, Americans join the people of the United Kingdom in mourning the sad passing of Queen Elizabeth II. Over her seven decades on the throne, Her Majesty was a pillar of leadership in the global arena and a devoted friend of freedom.
ENTJ|.@HouseDemocrats continue our work to put #PeopleOverPolitics with our Bipartisan Safer Communities Law that closes gun loopholes and expands background checks — keeping guns out of dangerous hands and protecting families from harm.
ENTJ|Grateful for Americas friendship with the Dutch people, the Congress looks forward to continuing our shared work forging a safer, healthier, more prosperous world for all.
ENTJ|We also discussed both the opportunities and challenges that social media presents to our society and to our children. On these and other issues, we found common ground and shared values. 
ENTJ|I commended the Netherlands bold leadership on climate, and I proudly accepted Her Majestys praise for our efforts – in California and across America – to build a sustainable future.
ENTJ|Today, I had the honor of engaging in a working session with Her Majesty Queen Máxima of the Netherlands. 
ENTJ|Join @LondonBreed, @UP4Life, gun violence prevention leaders and me in San Francisco for a press conference on @HouseDemocrats’ nationwide Gun Violence Prevention Day of Action to discuss the #SaferCommunities Act and the House-passed Assault Weapons Ban. 
ENTJ|As extreme MAGA Republicans work to rip away life-saving drugs, Democrats are fiercely defending health freedom, protecting access to health care and lowering the cost of prescription drugs. Every day, Democrats are putting #PeopleOverPolitics. 
ENTJ|With the GOP’s utter disdain for our health, safety and freedom, it is only a matter of time that another drug, treatment, vaccine or health service becomes the next target of their extremism.
ENTJ|Since then, House Republicans have plotted an unhinged, dangerous campaign to punish our most personal decisions, from abortion care to birth control and more.
ENTJ|This extreme MAGA ruling comes just months after the Republican-controlled Supreme Court discarded precedent and privacy in overturning Roe v. Wade.
ENTJ|This decision also threatens vital preventative health services guaranteed under the Affordable Care Act, including birth control, vaccinations and routine health screenings.
ENTJ|This disturbing decision amounts to open homophobia unleashing unthinkable suffering and death specifically among the LGBTQ community.
ENTJ|Today, a radical, Republican-appointed federal judge ruled that employers can deny coverage for PrEP a drug proven to save lives from HIV/AIDS and a key strategy for ending the epidemic.
ENTJ|The Republican-stacked Supreme Court overturning Roe opened the door to more right-wing attacks on women – including our right to contraception. No one should be denied access to birth control. @HouseDemocrats’ Right to Contraception Act protects this fundamental freedom.
ENTJ|Under the leadership of the most pro-union President in our history, Democrats are also widening the path to prosperity by creating good-paying, union-protected jobs. 
ENTJ|The Democratic House has twice passed the Richard L. Trumka PRO Act to tear down these barriers and empower every American to fight for the just wages, fair benefits and fundamental dignity that they have earned.
ENTJ|Despite unions’ soaring popularity, Americans still face outrageous hurdles to exercising their most basic rights on the job – from union-busting corporations to broken, outdated labor laws.
ENTJ|Indeed, seven in ten non-union workers would consider organizing if given the opportunity – and @HouseDemocrats are committed to giving them that chance.
ENTJ|.@POTUS and Congressional Democrats are proud to fight alongside a burgeoning labor movement as we put #PeopleOverPolitics. Because we know that the middle class is the backbone of our Democracy – and the middle class has a union label on it.
ENTJ|This year, while marking the transformative achievements of America’s labor movement throughout our history, we celebrate an organizing wave that is reaching workplaces across the nation – from coffee shops and warehouses to newsrooms and ballparks.
ENTJ|On #LaborDay, our nation honors the skill, devotion and solidarity of the hard-working Americans who make up the heart of our economy and the foundation of our country’s strength. 
ENTJ|Here’s @HouseGOP’s Extreme MAGA Agenda 1. Criminalize women’s health care by banning abortion nationwide 2. Harm seniors by dismantling Social Security , Medicare 3. Attack Democracy by undermining elections Republicans are For Their Power. Democrats put #PeopleOverPolitics.
ENTJ|Thanks to @POTUS and @HouseDemocrats commitment to #MakeItInAmerica, American manufacturing has come roaring back. Since January 2021, our economy has added 660,000 manufacturing jobs. And major American companies have announced new plans to expand production on our shores.
ENTJ|In August, America created 315,000 jobs – continuing our strong, steady job growth. Democrats’ Rescue Plan , Infrastructure Law sparked this robust recovery. Now, we’re building on this momentum with our job-creating, cost-cutting CHIPS , Science and Inflation Reduction laws.
ENTJ|Every day, Democrats are putting People Over Politics lower costs, better-paying jobs and safer communities for all of America’s families. Read my full statement on the August Jobs Report here 
ENTJ|Our CHIPS , Science Act will create good-paying jobs in American semiconductor manufacturing , technological innovation. Our #InflationReductionAct will deliver 9 million new jobs in clean energy, while slashing prescription drug costs for seniors , energy bills for families.
ENTJ|This robust and ongoing jobs recovery was sparked by Democrats’ American Rescue Plan and furthered by our Infrastructure Law. Now, we are building on this momentum to lower kitchen table costs and create more opportunities for our workers.
ENTJ|The American people are rejecting Republicans’ extreme MAGA agenda – instead, choosing Democrats’ unifying vision of #PeopleOverPolitics. Read my full statement on President Biden’s Address on Defending Democracy here 
ENTJ|In stark contrast, under the strong leadership of @POTUS, Democrats have powered progress for America’s families. With our landmark laws to bring down costs, create better paying jobs and build safer communities, Democrats are demonstrating that Democracy can continue to deliver.
ENTJ|Extreme MAGA Republicans are orchestrating a sinister campaign. By criminalizing womens health care, ending Social Security , Medicare , undermining our elections, the GOP is working to turn back the clock on fundamental liberties while fanning the flames of violence , division.
ENTJ|Every American who cares about the integrity of our Democracy, the fairness of our economy, the safety of our communities and the health of our planet is grateful to the President for his values-based vision and patriotic leadership.
ENTJ|Tonight, @POTUS Biden, in his inspiring and optimistic remarks, made crystal clear that our rights, our freedom and our Democracy are on the line.
ENTJ|In the days ahead, we will continue to work with Chairman Pallone to address California’s concerns. 
ENTJ|California’s landmark privacy laws and the new kids age-appropriate design bill, both of which received unanimous and bipartisan support in both chambers, must continue to protect Californians — and states must be allowed to address rapid changes in technology.
ENTJ|Proudly, California leads the nation not only in innovation, but also in consumer protection. With so much innovation happening in our state, it is imperative that California continues offering and enforcing the nation’s strongest privacy rights.
ENTJ|However, Governor Newsom, the California Privacy Protection Agency and top state leaders have pointed out the American Data Privacy and Protection Act does not guarantee the same essential consumer protections as California’s existing privacy laws.
ENTJ|The Energy and Commerce Committee is to be commended for its work on federal data privacy legislation. Importantly, Democrats won the right for consumers for the first time to be able to seek damages in court for violations of their privacy rights.
ENTJ|It was a pleasure to join @RepJoeNeguse at @NCARScience for a discussion on how Democrats’ Inflation Reduction Act is helping America combat the climate crisis by fueling scientific research and innovation across the country. 
ENTJ|While @HouseGOP plots a national abortion ban, @HouseDemocrats are defending health freedom. While they seek to dismantle Social Security , Medicare, were slashing seniors health costs. While they attack Democracy, were putting #PeopleOverPolitics. The contrast is clear.
ENTJ|Spearheaded by the @bamhtf, Congress will continue working, on a bipartisan basis, to support all those fighting to overcome addiction combating stigma, expanding access to care and supporting the caregivers helping them on their journey toward recovery.
ENTJ|As our nation marks the beginning of #NationalRecoveryMonth, @HouseDemocrats stand with the millions of Americans battling substance use disorders. Exacerbated by the trauma of the pandemic, the fight against addiction is more urgent than ever.
ENTJ|Democrats are putting #PeopleOverPolitics creating good-paying jobs as we return America to world leader status in chips manufacturing, rebuild our roads, bridges and transit systems, and combat the climate crisis.
ENTJ|.@HouseDemocrats are working to create good-paying jobs , make more products in America. Our #BipartisanInfrastructureLaw creates millions of jobs rebuilding America’s roads, bridges , transit systems. The CHIPS , Science Law brings semiconductor manufacturing back to the U.S.
ENTJ|For decades, Democrats have fought to bring down the cost of prescription drugs. Our #InflationReductionAct takes a giant step toward this goal empowering Medicare to negotiate the price of prescription drugs , ensuring seniors don’t pay more than $2000/yr for their medication.
ENTJ|While @HouseGOP and special interests work to keep prices high for families, @HouseDemocrats put #PeopleOverPolitics by taking action to lower drug prices and bring down costs at the grocery store and gas pump, keeping more money in families pockets.
ENTJ|Extreme MAGA Republicans only care about power. That’s why they want to - Criminalize women’s health care , roll back marriage equality - End Social Security , Medicare - Attack our Democracy , undermine elections @HouseDemocrats are fighting back , put #PeopleOverPolitics.
ENTJ|We have a responsibility to the next generation to ensure they will inherit a planet with clean air, clean water and limitless possibilities. With our Inflation Reduction Act, the Democratic Congress is meeting this responsibility and building a cleaner, greener future. 
ENTJ|This week, I joined @RepJimmyGomez at the Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator to discuss Democrats’ historic climate action in the #InflationReductionAct. 
ENTJ|Democrats’ #InflationReductionAct has three parts 1. Lowering the cost of health care 2. Delivering the historic climate action 3. Dramatically reducing the deficit. And it’s all fully paid for simply by asking the ultra-rich and big corporations to pay their fair share.
ENTJ|We are committed to defending women’s rights, freedoms and rightful place at the decision-making table. Because we know this truth when women succeed, America succeeds. Read my full statement on Women’s Equality Day 
ENTJ|Today, @HouseDemocrats are mobilizing for a Day of Action across the nation a growing drumbeat of fierce opposition to these right-wing attacks. While Republicans seek to turn back the clock for women, House Democrats will never relent in our fight to put #PeopleOverPolitics.
ENTJ|Unwavering in our commitment to reproductive justice, the Democratic House has passed landmark legislation to enshrine the protections of Roe v. Wade into law, establish a federal right to use birth control and reaffirm Americans’ right to access health care across state lines.
ENTJ|As we celebrate this triumph in our history, women’s most basic rights and dignities remain under assault. In the wake of the heart-wrenching Dobbs decision, Republicans have waged a dark crusade of punishment and control – even seeking to impose a national abortion ban.
ENTJ|Today, American women proudly carry on the spirit of the heroes who came before us marching in the streets, organizing in our communities and legislating in the halls of power.
ENTJ|Too often unsung in the American story, courageous women of color continued advancing that struggle for decades after – moving us ever closer to realizing our founding promise of liberty and justice for all.
ENTJ|In winning the right to vote more than a century ago, trailblazing suffragists tore down a seemingly immovable barrier to women’s full and equal citizenship in our Democracy.
ENTJ|Today, the American people mark the 102nd anniversary of the 19th Amendment a hard-won victory secured by generations of women bravely fighting to build a more perfect union. 
ENTJ|Our #AmericanRescuePlan powered unprecedented job growth with 9.4 million jobs since January 2021. Now, @HouseDemocrats are maintaining this momentum creating millions of good-paying jobs with our Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, CHIPS , Science Law , Inflation Reduction Law.
ENTJ|Join @RepJimmyGomez and me at the @LAIncubator in Los Angeles to highlight the climate action taken with the #InflationReductionAct, which is the largest investment in climate in American history. 
ENTJ|Join local public health leaders, San Franciscans who will benefit from lower costs and me for a press conference celebrating the health care provisions in the #InflationReductionAct which will lower health care and prescription drug costs. 
ENTJ|Democrats will continue fighting for strong K-12 public schools, affordable community college and lifetime learning for workers, so that every American can succeed in the 21st Century. 
ENTJ|Our American Rescue Plan invested nearly $40 billion in colleges and universities – with substantial funding for Minority Serving Institutions. Democrats secured a $400 increase in the maximum Pell Grant, and our CHIPS , Science Act is widening the pathway to a STEM education.
ENTJ|This action will help those most in need, easing a financial burden disproportionately harming women and people of color. Guided by @POTUS commitment to justice and equity, Democrats are opening the gates of higher education for those who have long been left behind.
ENTJ|.@POTUS’ bold action is a strong step in Democrats’ fight to expand access to higher education. By delivering historic targeted student debt relief to millions of borrowers, more working families will be able to meet their kitchen table needs as they recover from the pandemic.
ENTJ|Today, Congress extends our warmest wishes to the people of Ukraine as they celebrate 31 years of independence. America remains unwavering in our support for Ukraine’s courageous fight to defeat tyranny and defend democracy — for their nation and for the world. Slava Ukraini!
ENTJ|As @POTUS prepares to host a White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition and Health next month, @HouseDemocrats are committed to seizing this opportunity. Working together, we will not relent until we secure for our children a future free from the suffering of hunger. 
ENTJ|Yesterday, I had the privilege of visiting the @SFMFoodBank alongside @RepMcGovern and localleaders in the fight against hunger. Hunger is a painful, daily reality from coast to coast. Such profound injustice demands action from each of us. 
ENTJ|Join @RepMcGovern, community leaders and me at the @SFMFoodBank for a roundtable discussion and listening session on the work being done to combat hunger and food insecurity ahead of the @WhiteHouse Conference on Hunger, Nutrition and Health. 
ENTJ|.@HouseDemocrats are taking strong action to put #PeopleOverPolitics working to bring down the costs of prescription drugs, food and fuel so working families have breathing room in their budgets. But @HouseGOP voted against this action siding with corporations over families.
ENTJ|The climate crisis has reached code red — and Democrats are fighting back. Our bold new law, the #InflationReductionAct, will create 9 million good-paying jobs slashing carbon pollution by 40% by 2030 while powering America toward a sustainable clean energy future.
ENTJ|Big corporations are pushing up prices , squeezing working families while reaping record profits. @HouseDemocrats put #PeopleOverPolitics working to bring down costs , getting more money in families’ pockets, while giving the people’s interest leverage over special interest.
ENTJ|Last year, nearly 65 million Americans received Social Security benefits. Yet, the Extreme MAGA Republicans continue to blurt out their dangerous plans to dismantle Social Security and Medicare. 
ENTJ|Democrats’ #InflationReductionAct is a robust cost-cutting package that meets this moment ensuring that our families thrive and that our planet survives. But every single Republican — House and Senate — voted against this resounding victory For the People.
ENTJ|From the Industrial Revolution to the Digital Age, America has led the world to one breakthrough after another. This landmark legislation is carrying on that proud tradition – reinvigorating American innovation and investing in our nations brightest minds.
ENTJ|Today, I joined @RepAnnaEshoo and STEM leaders from across the Bay Area to celebrate Democrats CHIPS and Science Act – a monumental step toward meeting and beating the challenges of the 21st Century. 
ENTJ|The American people deserve a government that protects hard-working families – not billionaires and special interests. That’s why @HouseDemocrats put #PeopleOverPolitics lowering costs, creating better-paying jobs and building safer communities.
ENTJ|With our #InflationReductionAct, Democrats are striking a big blow to break the stranglehold of Big Oil and Big Pharma on our government. By slashing health care costs and taking bold climate action, this new law puts People Over Politics.
ENTJ|The Inflation Reduction Act delivers a resounding victory for America’s families and for our planet. Sadly, not a single Republican voted for this deeply needed new law. But with President Biden’s signature, Democrats have once again put #PeopleOverPolitics.
ENTJ|This package is a powerful force to fight inflation. According to leading economists, it will fight inflation and lower costs for American families while setting the stage for strong, stable, and broadly-shared long-term economic growth. 
ENTJ|Make no mistake the #InflationReductionAct is fully paid for by ensuring the wealthiest few and biggest corporations pay their fair share. And there are no new taxes on families making $400,000 or less or on small businesses.
ENTJ|Meanwhile, the #InflationReductionAct helps fight inflation for families in the long-term. Making an historic investment in paying down the deficit by $300 billion this decade and $2 trillion over two decades will help cool inflation for years to come.
ENTJ|The #InflationReductionAct delivers the biggest, boldest climate action in history. This law will save families’ up to $1000/year on energy bills and bolster America’s energy independence — all while slashing carbon pollution by roughly 40 percent by 2030.
ENTJ|If you’re one of the 13 million working Americans with an affordable plan under the ACA The #InflationReductionAct will keep saving you an average of $800/year. This new law locks in lower health care premiums, so you’ll be able to keep your coverage and save on health costs.
ENTJ|If you’re a senior the #InflationReductionAct slashes your prescription drug costs. By empowering Medicare to negotiate drug prices, preventing excessive price hikes faster than inflation and capping out-of-pocket costs to $2,000 per year, youll keep more money in your pocket.
ENTJ|.@POTUS just signed into law Democrats’ #InflationReductionAct. This historic legislation will lower kitchen table costs, create good-paying jobs, deliver the most significant action on climate in history while reducing the deficit. Here’s what it means for you
ENTJ|My office will continue working with Mayor @LondonBreed and the Biden Administration tosupport the dedicated staff of Laguna Honda to make necessary improvements and ensure the hospital remainsa pillar of health for some of our Citys most vulnerable residents.
ENTJ|It is welcome news to learn that @CMSGov, @CAPublicHealth , @SFGov have taken an essential step forward to continue funding Laguna Honda Hospital through November 13th without the trauma of transferring residents, ensuring that patients will continue receiving the care they need.
ENTJ|Join local community leaders , me at the Rosa Parks Senior Center in San Francisco to mark the 87th anniversary of Social Security, celebrate its impact , reaffirm our commitment to defending Social Security against Republicans’ extreme MAGA attacks. 
ENTJ|We will never relent in safeguarding Social Security and strengthening the economic security of every family lowering costs, creating jobs and building safer communities. Read my full statement on the 87th Anniversary of Social Security here 
ENTJ|While Republicans prioritize their own power, Democrats are putting #PeopleOverPolitics. Tomorrow, @HouseDemocrats will join with seniors across the country for a nationwide Day of Action – reaffirming our commitment to defending Social Security against right-wing attacks.
ENTJ|Today, tens of millions of Americans rely on their hard-earned Social Security checks to get by each month. Rather than safeguarding and strengthening these essential benefits, extreme MAGA Republicans are seeking to destroy Social Security as we know it.
ENTJ|For generations, Social Security has been a pillar of financial stability bringing peace of mind to those in retirement, living with a disability or grieving a loved one. Yet, Republicans are continuing their extreme efforts to unwind this transformative legislative achievement.
ENTJ|Nearly nine decades ago, amid the turmoil and hardship of the Great Depression, President Franklin Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act – ensuring that, after a lifetime of hard work, seniors could enjoy the dignity of a secure retirement.
ENTJ|Check out behind-the-scenes photos for more insight into how House Democrats put #PeopleOverPolitics this week in ‘Madam Speaker.’ 
ENTJ|This was a momentous week #ForThePeople, capped off by House Democrats’ passage of the Inflation Reduction Act – lowering families’ kitchen table costs, combating the climate crisis, creating millions of good-paying jobs and dramatically reducing the deficit.
ENTJ|Republicans voted against lowering health care , prescription drug costs, against climate action, against deficit reduction, against big companies paying their fair share , against Americas families. With the #InflationReductionAct, Democrats voted to put #PeopleOverPolitics. 
ENTJ|This transformative bill will lower health care costs, combat the climate crisis and dramatically reduce the deficit. This bill is a victory for America’s families and for our planet – advancing the people’s interest over the special interest. 
ENTJ|Today, @HouseDemocrats passed the Inflation Reduction Act to ensure our families thrive and our planet survives. I am proud to send this life-changing legislation to @POTUS for his signature. Together, Democrats are fighting to put #PeopleOverPolitics.

ENTJ|Named in honor of Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson – an American hero stolen away by cancerous toxins – this legislation is a major victory that will save lives and protect the health of those who fought to protect us.
ENTJ|Yesterday, we took a another step toward fully honoring the service and sacrifice of our nation’s veterans with the enrollment of the Honoring Our PACT Act — sending it to @POTUS’ desk for his signature today. 
ENTJ|For generations, America has been a beacon of excellence to the world in science, innovation , engineering. This legislation honors this all-American tradition ensuring America can outcompete any nation on Earth and our beacon of excellence will glow for generations to come. 
ENTJ|Today, I was proud to join @SenSchumer, @SecRaimondo, Members of Congress , advocates as @POTUS’ signed the #CHIPSandScience Act into law. With his signature, America declared economic independence, strengthened its national security , enhanced our families’ financial future.

ENTJ|We look forward to the IRS complying with this ruling and delivering the requested documents so that Ways and Means can begin its oversight responsibilities of the mandatory presidential audit program.

ENTJ|By defending America’s energy security and reducing carbon pollution by nearly 40 percent by the end of the decade, it will slash energy costs and help save the planet.
ENTJ|Today is a victory for America’s families and for our planet. This landmark legislation, which includes key proposals from @HouseDemocrats, will rein in health care costs extending Affordable Care Act subsidies and empowering Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices.
ENTJ|Congratulations to @SenateDems for the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act. This bill is a major step forward in Democrats fight to put #PeopleOverPolitics lowering kitchen table costs, reducing the cost of health care, creating jobs and addressing the climate crisis.
ENTJ|While MAGA Republicans continue attacking our Democracy and undermining our elections, Democrats are focused on putting #PeopleOverPolitics ensuring every American has a say in our nation’s destiny. 
ENTJ|The House has also twice passed Democrats’ #ForThePeople Act to combat GOP voter suppression, end partisan gerrymandering and get dark money out of our politics crucial steps to revitalize American Democracy. We will never relent in our fight to enact these measures into law.
ENTJ|Endlessly inspired by the courage and sacrifice of its heroic namesake, our Democratic House Majority passed the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act to restore the heart of the VRA and stamp out voting discrimination wherever it appears.
ENTJ|.@HouseDemocrats are committed to standing against this shameless assault on Democracy, and we have fought alongside tireless activists to pass urgently needed federal voting protections.
ENTJ|Unleashed by the Supreme Court’s Shelby v. Holder decision, GOP state lawmakers are waging a vicious campaign against the foundation of our Republic — seeking to challenge the legitimacy of our elections and roll back the clock on voting access for communities of color.
ENTJ|Yet nearly six decades after this pillar of justice and Democracy was signed into law, extreme MAGA Republicans are still attempting to erase Americans’ sacred right to vote and even nullify the results of fair, free elections.
ENTJ|This transformative achievement – made possible by generations of Americans who bravely fought, marched and organized – cracked down on racist voter discrimination and opened the doors of polling places across the country.
ENTJ|On this day 57 years ago, our nation took an historic step toward forging a more perfect union with the landmark Voting Rights Act, helping realize our founding ideal government of, by and for the people. 
ENTJ|While Republicans seek to criminalize women’s health care, dismantle Social Security and Medicare and continue to attack our democracy, Democrats are putting People Over Politics fighting for lower costs, better-paying jobs and safer communities for all. 
ENTJ|Just last week, the Democratic Congress sent to President Biden’s desk the game-changing CHIPS and Science Act, which will lower costs for families , lay the foundation for decades of economic growth by reinvigorating American manufacturing and turbocharging American innovation.
ENTJ|The Democratic Congress will soon pass our historic Inflation Reduction Act, taking bold action to bring down the kitchen table costs – from health care premiums to prescription drug costs to energy prices – while closing tax loopholes and paying down the deficit.
ENTJ|As we continue to power healthy jobs growth, Democrats are ferociously fighting back against the global inflation weighing on America’s families.
ENTJ|July’s strong jobs growth demonstrates that Democrats’ economic agenda is driving a steady and robust recovery. Just a year and a half into @POTUS’ term, more Americans are working than ever before — and millions of families have the dignity and security of a regular paycheck.
ENTJ|Today, we honor the lives stolen from us 10 years ago in an act of hate at the Sikh Temple in Wisconsin, Oak Creek. House Democrats continue to fight against bigotry and gun violence to forge a stronger and safer future for our children. #RememberingOakCreek
ENTJ|Here in Japan , across the world, our valiant heroes in uniform are guardians of Democracy. It was an honor to meet with Lt. Gen. Rupp, Vice Adm. Walden , other @USForcesJapan , @US7thFleet servicemembers today to bring the gratitude of the Congress for their patriotic service. 
ENTJ|Our delegation met with @HosodaHiroyuki, Speaker of the House of Representatives of the Japanese Diet. We discussed our shared democratic values, enhancing inter-parliamentary relationships, and advancing peace and stability in the Indo Pacific. 
ENTJ|Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was an historic leader of Japan, a valued friend to America and a global champion of peace and prosperity. It was my personal honor to pay tribute to Prime Minister Abe today at the Diet where he served for decades. May he rest in peace.

ENTJ|Our visit reiterates that America stands with Taiwan a robust, vibrant democracy and our important partner in the Indo-Pacific.

ENTJ|Our visit is one of several Congressional delegations to Taiwan – and it in no way contradicts longstanding United States policy, guided by the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, U.S.-China Joint Communiques and the Six Assurances.
ENTJ|America’s solidarity with the 23 million people of Taiwan is more important today than ever, as the world faces a choice between autocracy and democracy.

ENTJ|Under President Biden and our nation’s many devoted national security professionals, America’s counterterrorism capabilities remain unrivaled, and our nation’s resolve to hunt down terrorists who threaten our families remains ironclad. 
ENTJ|The President is to be commended for his strong leadership to keep Americans safe and to deliver justice to this despicable terrorist.
ENTJ|.@POTUS announced that, at his direction, the United States killed Ayman al-Zawahri a top leader of al-Qaeda, an enemy of America and one of the masterminds behind the attacks on September 11th.

ENTJ|Im leading a Congressional delegation to the Indo-Pacific to reaffirm America’s unshakeable commitment to our allies , friends in the region. In Singapore, Malaysia, South Korea , Japan, we’ll hold high-level meetings to discuss how we can further our shared interests , values.
ENTJ|We will never relent in our fight to build a healthier, more secure future for all Americans expanding coverage, bringing down premiums and slashing prescription drug costs. Read my full statement here 
ENTJ|.@HouseDemocrats are standing up to these cruel attacks and fighting for greater access to quality, affordable health care. Through the Affordable Care Act, Democrats have expanded Medicaid coverage to 21 million Americans.
ENTJ|Yet even as we celebrate one of our nation’s greatest legislative achievements, Republicans are plotting to end Medicare and Medicaid entirely – tearing away coverage from tens of millions of Americans.
ENTJ|57 years ago, the U.S. fundamentally transformed the way we care for the most vulnerable members of our society. In the decades since President Johnson signed Medicare , Medicaid into law, they have stood as pillars of health, security , justice for generations of Americans.
ENTJ|This week, 80% of Republicans in the Senate voted against important life-saving legislation that honored the service and sacrifice of our nations veterans. Democrats know that when our veterans come home, we cant leave them behind. #PeopleOverPolitics 
ENTJ|Today, our nation took a monumental step forward to equip America to meet and beat the challenges of the 21st Century with the CHIPS , Science Act. By sending this bill to President Biden’s desk, Democrats continue to fight for lower costs and more jobs for America’s families. 
ENTJ|Join me live at the U.S. Capitol for my weekly press conference. 
ENTJ|Join me at the U.S. Capitol to enroll the #CHIPSandScienceAct. This historic package will lower costs for families, make critical semiconductors in America instead of overseas and turbocharge American science , research - now and for decades to come. 
ENTJ|I support the decision to pause transfers , discharges from Laguna Honda. City, state , federal officials must work together to address areas of concern , protect this provider with a path to recertification, while minimizing transfer trauma , putting patient safety , care first.
ENTJ|Spearheaded by @DorisMatsui, this legislation will secure a fairer, more accessible digital future by enshrining into federal law a common-sense value everyone deserves access to affordable, high-speed internet service. 
ENTJ|Today, @HouseDemocrats are introducing the Net Neutrality and Broadband Justice Act to close the digital divide, advance equity throughout our economy and empower all Americans to thrive in the 21st Century. #NetNeutrality
ENTJ|Today, @DemWomenCaucus and @ProChoiceCaucus gathered to shine a light on Republicans’ twisted vision for America #WithoutRoe — a dark agenda of punishment, control and complicity in horrific abuse. We are standing strong — saying loud and clear We are not going back. 
ENTJ|Join @RepJayapal, @RepJudyChu, @FrankPallone, advocates , me for an event celebrating the passage of the South Asian Health Awareness and Research Act, a bill aimed at curbing the rate of heart disease , death in the South Asian American community.

ENTJ|Join @SenGillibrand, @SenatorTester, @RepMarkTakano, @JonStewart, advocates and me for a press conference on the Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act, important legislation to honor the service and sacrifice of our nations veterans. 
ENTJ|Why are Republicans opposing this popular, bipartisan legislation? Simply because Democrats today announced plans to lower health premiums, slash the cost of prescription drugs , act to save the planet from the climate crisis. Their position is extreme, harmful , disgraceful.
ENTJ|Today, @SenateGOP blocked a bipartisan bill to expand benefits for sick veterans. Now, @HouseGOP leaders are whipping against a bipartisan bill to create jobs, lower costs , reinvigorate American science , manufacturing. Shamefully, Republicans are putting politics over people.
ENTJ|Democrats put #PeopleOverPolitics — fighting for lower costs, better paying jobs and safer communities. Today, Republicans are proving theyre just the opposite — willing to play partisan games with the health , financial security of the American people.
ENTJ|Read my full Dear Colleague to Members on the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 here 
ENTJ|This agreement also honors @POTUS pledge no new taxes on families making less than $400,000 , no new taxes on small businesses. We will continue to fight for priorities not contained in this legislation — because more must be done for America’s working families , the planet.
ENTJ|This agreement would reduce the deficit and help fight inflation by allocating an historic $300 billion for deficit reduction. It is also fully paid for by implementing a 15 percent corporate minimum tax and strengthening IRS enforcement.
ENTJ|The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 reduces the cost of health care for millions, allows Medicare to negotiate the price of prescription drugs, reduces carbon pollution by roughly 40 percent by 2030, lowers energy costs and advances energy security.
ENTJ|This afternoon, @SenSchumer and @SenJoeManchin announced a breakthrough in their negotiations on the Reconciliation bill. This agreement contains many of @POTUS Biden’s proposals and @HouseDemocrats priorities.
ENTJ|The House Rules Committee will meet shortly to take up the CHIPS and Science Act. Then, the House will proudly pass this essential legislation and send it to President Biden to be signed into law. 
ENTJ|Crucially, these federal investments come with strong guardrails, ensuring they go straight into our economy — not into corporate pockets.
ENTJ|Once enacted, the CHIPS and Science Act will bolster our nation’s production of semiconductor chips — reinvigorating American manufacturing and creating nearly 100,000 good-paying, union jobs.
ENTJ|This bold, bipartisan legislation contains key House proposals to lower costs, create good-paying jobs, reduce our dependence on foreign manufacturers and turbocharge American innovation. It is a major victory for American families and the American economy.
ENTJ|With the Senate’s passage of the CHIPS and Science Act, Congress has taken a key step toward enacting transformative investments to strengthen families’ financial future, boost America’s research advantage and safeguard our economic and national security for generations to come.
ENTJ|With this majestic statue, we pay tribute to a giant and a revolutionary – not only in women’s history, but in human history. Children who visit can set their sights higher, knowing they, too, can reach for the sky.
ENTJ|Not only was she an outstanding aviator - she was also an outspoken champion for gender equity. She founded The 99s – which remains today a powerful force for female pilots all around the world. 
ENTJ|Amelia Earhart’s name is synonymous with courage. She was the first woman, and only the second person, to fly solo across the Atlantic. In doing so, she set records for speed and time elapsed between two continents.
ENTJ|As Speaker of the House, it was my privilege to host a statue unveiling in Statuary Hall to celebrate an American who personifies the daring and determined spirit of our nation Amelia Earhart. 
ENTJ|Join Congressional Leadership, Members of the Kansas Congressional Delegation, @GovLauraKelly , me in the U.S. Capitol as we unveil a new statue of Amelia Earhart one of the worlds most celebrated aviators , a champion of women in aviation. 
ENTJ|Join @JimLangevin, @LeaderHoyer, @SenBobCasey, the Bipartisan Disabilities Caucus, advocates , me for a celebration of 32 years of the Americans With Disabilities Act, a pillar of civil rights upholding justice, dignity , respect. 
ENTJ|Our House Democratic Majority is defending health freedom! We passed our Women’s Health Protection Act , Ensuring Women’s Right to Reproductive Freedom Act to protect a women’s right to make her own health care decisions. Meanwhile, @HouseGOP wants to ban abortion nationwide.
ENTJ|With respect for what each of our fellow Americans can do and compassion for what they cannot, let us renew our resolve to realize our founding promise that all are equal under the law. Read my full statement here 
ENTJ|Driven by the leadership and advocacy of America’s disability community, House Democrats remain unwavering in our fight to build a more equal and accessible nation.
ENTJ|With our Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Democratic Congress delivered new funding to strengthen mobility services and complete ADA upgrades at transit stations across the country — more than a quarter of which are currently inaccessible.
ENTJ|.@HouseDemocrats are fighting to build on the ADA’s transformative achievements, guided by @POTUS Biden’s commitment to placing equity at the heart of our agenda #ForThePeople.
ENTJ|More than three decades ago, our nation took bold, bipartisan action to advance fairness and opportunity for millions of Americans living with a disability. Today, the Americans with Disabilities Act remains a pillar of civil rights — upholding justice, dignity and respect.
ENTJ|.@HouseDemocrats passed bipartisan and bicameral legislation to enshrine into law a fundamental freedom the right to marry whomever you choose. Shamefully, 157 Republicans do not believe marriage equality should be the law of the land.
ENTJ|Democrats are fighting to turbocharge semiconductor production with our Chips Act for America – reinvigorating auto plants, creating nearly 100,000 Davis-Bacon jobs, slashing costs for working families and bolstering America’s independence from foreign manufacturers.
ENTJ|It was a privilege to join the brothers and sisters of @UAW as @HouseDemocrats create and defend good-paying union jobs in Michigan. 
ENTJ|Our American Rescue Plan and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law have helped power historic job gains – and now @HouseDemocrats are working to lower costs. Our agenda brings down prices at the pump , at the grocery store while making more in America , strengthening supply chains.
ENTJ|Americans should have access to contraception. That’s why @HouseDemocrats took another strong step this week to protect freedom by passing the Right to Contraception Act. See what else happened in Congress this week on ‘Madam Speaker.’ 
ENTJ|The historic drop in unemployment across the country is a sign of progress, but more needs to be done to fight the challenges of global inflation. @HouseDemocrats and @POTUS continue to work on the kitchen table concerns American families are facing right now.
ENTJ|Punishing and controlling women for using birth control is just another plank in @HouseGOP extreme agenda for America. Nearly every Republican made that clear yesterday, opposing our bill to enshrine the fundamental right to contraception into law. 
ENTJ|Today, a jury found Trump associate Steve Bannon guilty for defying a lawful Congressional subpoena , obstructing the patriotic work of @January6thCmte. This is a triumph of our system of checks , balances and a step forward for justice, reaffirming that no one is above the law.
ENTJ|Thanks to the leadership of @RepBlumenauer, @RepDelBene, @RepDanKildee , @RepJohnLarson, the Formula Act is now the law of the land! This legislation lowers costs for families, strengthens the supply chain to avoid future shortages , ensures children get the nutrition they need.
ENTJ|Today, 197 Members of @HouseGOP made clear that they dont believe women have a right to contraception. These extremist Republicans don’t want women to have birth control - they want to control women. And @HouseDemocrats are fighting back! 
ENTJ|Join me live at the U.S. Capitol for my weekly press conference. 
ENTJ|Tomorrow, we will pass our Right to Contraception Act, protecting access to birth control for every woman everywhere. With its passage, Democrats make clear we will never quit in the fight against the outrageous right-wing assault on freedom. 
ENTJ|It is outrageous that – sixty years after Griswold was decided – women must again fight for our basic right to birth control. I joined @HouseDemocrats to highlight how we’re fighting back against extremist Republican attempts to roll back the clock on contraception. 
ENTJ|Join @NatUrbanLeague, advocates and me as we speak about the continued fight for civil rights. 
ENTJ|The Ukrainian people have displayed unimaginable heroism, as they confront unconscionable atrocities. The Congress remains with Ukraine as it fights to defend Democracy – not only for its people but for the world. 
ENTJ|Today, the Congress was honored to hear from the First Lady of Ukraine, @ZelenskaUA. As Russia continues its cruel invasion, she has traveled here from the heart of the warzone to provide a report on security, economic and humanitarian conditions on the ground. 
ENTJ|In honor of those killed in Aurora and all those taken from us in the decade since, let us continue fighting to bring our nation’s gun epidemic to an end once and for all. Read my full statement here 
ENTJ|The House has twice passed widely-popular background checks legislation. Last week, we voted to establish an AMBER Alert-style system to warn communities of an active shooting. And today, @HouseJudiciary is moving forward with a landmark assault weapons ban.
ENTJ|Last month, @POTUS and the Democratic Congress enacted the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act – our nation’s first major gun violence prevention legislation in nearly three decades. This was a key step forward, but @HouseDemocrats know that further action is needed to save lives.
ENTJ|In the decade since this heart-wrenching attack, America’s drumbeat of gun violence has continued to claim innocent lives – devastating more communities and tearing apart more families. Driven by the courage of survivors and advocates, Democrats have fought to end the bloodshed.
ENTJ|Ten years ago, an act of senseless mass violence stole the lives of 12 Americans on what should have been a joyful night out. This tragedy shocked Aurora and the nation, inflicting renewed fear for the safety of our own loved ones – at work, in church and even at the movies.
ENTJ|Join @RepKManning, @RepSaraJacobs, @RepAngieCraig, @RepUnderwood, , me for an event on the Right to Contraception Act, legislation enshrining into law the right to access , use contraceptives , taking action against states who stop access to birth control. 
ENTJ|Join Members of Congress and me at the U.S. Capitol as we hear remarks by First Lady Of Ukraine @ZelenskaUA and convey our unwavering support for the people of Ukraine. 
ENTJ|After the Supreme Court dispensed with privacy and precedent in overturning Roe, extremist Republicans are now taking aim at marriage equality. 157 Republicans today voted against @HouseDemocrats bill to enshrine into law the freedom to marry whomever you love. 
ENTJ|In the House, those fortunate to serve with him treasure the lessons he taught us – especially to think regionally and environmentally, not individually. Our nation is safer and stronger because of his lifelong public service. 
ENTJ|Although he suffered the horrors of internment, he still chose to devote his life to serving the nation that had turned its back on him. His pioneering career opened the doors for countless AAPI leaders to follow along the extraordinary trail he blazed.
ENTJ|Today, the Congress celebrated the life and legacy of Norm Mineta a statesman, pioneer and patriot who served in the House with distinction for 20 years. It was my high honor to present to his family a flag flown over the United States Capitol in his honor. 
ENTJ|Republicans are seeking to advance the extreme goal of a federal law criminalizing abortion in all 50 states – ripping away women’s right to make their own reproductive health decisions. Democrats are fighting to defend women’s right to reproductive freedom.
ENTJ|Because of the Republican Party’s extreme goal of ripping away women’s rights, American women today have less freedom than their mothers. In the states, we are already seeing the horrifying consequences of this extreme agenda.
ENTJ|.@HouseDemocrats are fighting back against the GOP assault on health freedom with our Ensuring Women’s Right to Reproductive Freedom Act. This would stop the GOP from punishing women for exercising their Constitutional right to travel across state lines for an abortion.
ENTJ|This week, Democrats took action to defend reproductive freedom. Because a woman’s health decisions belong to her alone – not to politicians in Congress, state capitols or the Supreme Court. See what else happened with my Medium post, ‘Madam Speaker.’ 
ENTP|Michelle and I started the @ObamaFoundation to support the next generation of leaders creating sustainable change in their communities. This week, Ill be joining our Obama Leaders in Greece where we’ll share ideas and dive deeper into the work they’re doing.

ENTP|DACA recipients are teachers, service members, business owners, doctors, and parents. They are our friends and neighbors. We are a better nation—a stronger nation—because they’re here. As we mark the 11th anniversary of DACA, let’s continue to organize and push Congress to build an immigration system that offers these Americans a permanent pathway to citizenship.
ENTP|Congrats to the Denver @Nuggets and the remarkable finals MVP Nikola Jokić for bringing home the franchise’s first NBA Championship!

ENTP|This Memorial Day, take a moment to honor the brave Americans who have served our country and given their lives for our freedom. May God bless our fallen heroes, their families, and all who serve. 
ENTP|The rise of antisemitic attacks should alarm all of us. Antisemitism and bigotry - like all forms of hate - have no place in our world, and it’s on each of us to combat this growing threat. @POTUS is right to take on this issue, and he deserves our support. 
ENTP|Its a reminder that, while the pace of change can often be slow, a small group of people can still help us take a giant leap forward – but only if we vote.
ENTP|Since then, Minnesota has made progress on a whole host of issues – from protecting abortion rights and new gun safety measures to expanding access to the ballot and reducing child poverty. These laws will make a real difference in the lives of Minnesotans.
ENTP|Earlier this year, Democrats took control of the State Senate by one seat after winning a race by just 321 votes. It gave Democrats control of both chambers of the state legislature and the governor’s mansion.
ENTP|If you need a reminder that elections have consequences, check out whats happening in Minnesota.

ENTP|Tina Turner was raw. She was powerful. She was unstoppable. And she was unapologetically herself—speaking and singing her truth through joy and pain, triumph and tragedy. Today we join fans around the world in honoring the Queen of Rock and Roll, and a star whose light will never fade.
ENTP|Bob was also a fierce advocate for the Obama Presidential Center, believing that it would be transformative for young folks on the South Side. His commitment helped inspire us to build the Center there. We’re deeply grateful for Bob’s remarkable service to a university and a city that has shaped so much of who we are. Our hearts go out to his wife Shadi, his three sons, Alex, Benjamin, and David, and the entire University of Chicago community during this difficult time.
ENTP|Michelle and I were saddened to learn about the passing of Bob Zimmer, the 13th President of the University of Chicago. Bob was a visionary leader and one the most influential university presidents in the country. During his time at the University of Chicago, he built upon its rigorous academic reputation, grew the university’s footprint around the world and throughout the South Side, and helped expand access through scholarships and financial aid.
ENTP|I was too young to remember Jim Brown’s playing days, but I knew his legacy. One of the greatest football players ever, he was also an actor and activist – speaking out on civil rights, and pushing other Black athletes to do the same. Our thoughts are with Jim’s wife Monique, his children, and everyone who knew and admired him.
ENTP|In Working What We Do All Day, I sat down with Luke to hear about his work, listen to some of his tracks, and discuss the life he wants for himself. You can watch this conversation and more in this new series now on Netflix. 
ENTP|I enjoyed meeting these folks and hearing their stories about work. Take a look at this preview, and watch Working What We Do All Day now on Netflix. 
ENTP|As a college student, I was inspired by Studs Terkel’s book, Working, which chronicled what ordinary people did for a living. Working What We Do All Day from @HGMedia is a new series that builds on that idea – sharing the stories of people from different walks of life, and giving you a window into the jobs they do every day. 
ENTP|Im thrilled to share that our latest show from @HGMedia, Working What We Do All Day, will be out on Netflix tomorrow. This show shares the powerful stories of everyday Americans and their relationship with work. I can’t wait for you to watch. 
ENTP|It was great talking to @NateBurleson about our work at the @MBKAlliance. Im proud of the hundreds of MBK communities across the country that are identifying barriers and helping young men and boys of color succeed. 
ENTP|Happy Mother’s Day! I hope you take a moment to appreciate all the moms and mother-figures in your life – and be there for people who may be missing theirs. To @MichelleObama, thanks for being such an amazing mom to our beautiful girls. You set an incredible example for all of us.
ENTP|I always love being in Chicago and having the opportunity to meet with folks on the South Side who are helping transform their communities. I had a lot of fun, too. Take a look. 
ENTP|Visiting Lilydale First Baptist Church took me back to my time as a community organizer. This is the neighborhood where I began my career in public service. It was even more special to celebrate the graduation of our @Columbia and @UChicago Obama Scholars—a smart and passionate group of young people who are picking up the baton and working to create sustainable change.
ENTP|You can learn more about this important work in communities across the country here 
ENTP|It was great spending time with members of our new @MBKAlliance Model Communities to talk about all the ways we can work together to make a difference. 
ENTP|Today I got to hear from @GuitarsOverGuns—one of @MBKAlliance’s Freedom Summer ‘22 recipients—about how they’re working to support young people on the South Side of Chicago. When the Obama Presidential Center opens, it will offer spaces and programming just like this. Thanks for letting me join!
ENTP|Newt Minow was a dear friend, mentor and early supporter of mine. He also embodied the ideal of public service – helping launch the satellites that made nationwide broadcasts possible, cementing presidential debates as a national institution, helping usher in public television, and reminding the media of its obligation to foster a well-informed citizenry. I will always owe a great debt to Newt, most of all because he helped introduce me to Michelle when we were both young lawyers in Chicago. We will miss him dearly, just as we miss his beloved wife, Jo, who passed away last year, and send our love and thoughts to their family.
ENTP|Journalists have always been on the front lines of the struggle for democracy. That’s why we need to keep standing up for the rights of journalists around the world. Grateful that we have @ColumbiaJourn and people like Jelani Cobb taking on this important work.
ENTP|Im so inspired by the @ObamaFoundation leaders I met today in Berlin. These young people are putting in the work to strengthen our communities and move democracy forward. 
ENTP|I’m excited to share the trailer for Working. In this series, I talk to American workers across various industries – from hospitality and technology to home care – to understand their jobs and hopes for the future. I hope you’ll check it out on @Netflix on May 17. 
ENTP|Harry Belafonte was a barrier-breaking legend who used his platform to lift others up. He lived a good life – transforming the arts while also standing up for civil rights. And he did it all with his signature smile and style. Michelle and I send our love to his wife, kids, and fans.
ENTP|Proud of all that @JoeBiden and his administration have accomplished these last few years. He’s delivered for the American people — and he’ll continue to do so once he’s re-elected. Let’s get to work! 
ENTP|Chicago knows how to show up! Thanks to all the volunteers who helped the @ObamaFoundation clean up Rainbow Beach, Washington Park, and Jackson Park—the future home of the Obama Presidential Center—for Earth Day. 
ENTP|Everybody deserves access to health care. @POTUS plan to expand health care coverage for DACA recipients will be life-changing for Dreamers across the country.
ENTP|Theres no place like Chicago! Michelle and I are thrilled to have the Democratic National Convention return to our hometown next year. 
ENTP|I want to wish all who celebrate a happy and blessed Easter. With everything going on in the world right now, it’s a chance to hug our loved ones tight and give thanks for new beginnings and the blessings we all enjoy.
ENTP|What happened in Tennessee is the latest example of a broader erosion of civility and democratic norms. Silencing those who disagree with us is a sign of weakness, not strength, and it won’t lead to progress.
ENTP|This nation was built on peaceful protest. No elected official should lose their job simply for raising their voice – especially when they’re doing it on behalf of our children.
ENTP|Today would have been @DrMayaAngelous 95th birthday. As a girl, she endured trauma and abuse that actually led her to stop speaking. But as a performer and writer, she found her voice—a voice that has spoken to millions, and inspired countless others over the years. 
ENTP|Wisconsin! It’s Election Day, and we need you to vote for your state Supreme Court justice and other local leaders. You can vote in person or drop off your completed absentee ballot at your polling place until 8 pm. Find out where to go at 
ENTP|Congrats to @UConnMBB! They were dominant throughout the tournament – and five titles since 1999 is pretty impressive.
ENTP|Some of the young men in our @MBKAlliance program were a part of the behind-the-scenes action during this year’s @MarchMadnessMBB Final Four. The future is bright for this group. 
ENTP|Congrats to the new champs, @LSUwbkb! They earned it, and I have a feeling we’ll be seeing a lot more from them in the years ahead.
ENTP|Our @ObamaFoundation leaders are working to protect trans rights and those in the LGBTQIA+ community around the world. Here are some of their stories
ENTP|On this Transgender Day of Visibility, Michelle and I want every trans person in America—and around the world—to know that we see you and we stand with you. Every LGBTQIA+ person deserves to feel safe and protected.
ENTP|Grateful to all the first responders and volunteers working to help those impacted by the Mississippi tornadoes. If youre looking for ways to help, heres how you can support folks right now. 
ENTP|We are failing our children. Guns are now the leading cause of death for children in the U.S. Michelle and I mourn with the students and families of the Covenant School today. 
ENTP|I hope their stories inspire you to help us protect the Affordable Care Act, so Americans everywhere can continue to get the care they need when they need it.
ENTP|To celebrate the 13th anniversary of the Affordable Care Act, @POTUS and I surprised some folks whose lives have been changed by the law. Paul, Mukta, and Sarah — thank you for sharing your powerful stories with us. 
ENTP|I know so many of you have a story of how access to health care changed your life, in big ways or small. At the @ObamaFoundation, we’re collecting stories that demonstrate the very real impact of the ACA. I’d love to hear yours. 
ENTP|Since 2010, the ACA has provided more than 40 million Americans access to health care, expanded Medicaid to 40 states to cover millions of low-income adults under 65, and protected more than 100 million people with preexisting conditions from losing their health insurance.
ENTP|Thirteen years ago today, I signed the Affordable Care Act into law. The night the ACA passed was incredibly meaningful, because we knew the law would have a profound impact on the lives of millions of people. And it has.
ENTP|At the @ObamaFoundation, we’ve been working to support the next generation of leaders tackling this issue, many of whom are on the front lines of the climate crisis—leaders across sectors, borders, and industries will be necessary to act with enough speed to meet the moment.
ENTP|Its also important to note that @POTUS and his administration have taken historic steps that move us closer than before to meeting the moment. That should give us hope that more progress can be achieved.
ENTP|The impacts of climate change are why we pushed so hard for the Paris Agreement during my time in office—no nation is immune from the harmful effects of this crisis and we all have a role to play in addressing it.
ENTP|This weeks climate report from the IPCC is an urgent reminder of the limited window we have to deal with the climate crisis. In order to limit temperature rise to 1.5 degrees, it will require everyone to do their part. 
ENTP|.@BChesky, @MichelleObama, and I created The Voyager Scholarship to support the next generation of leaders looking to pursue careers in public service. If youre a rising college junior in the United States, I hope youll apply by this Wednesday, 3/22 
ENTP|And if you’re looking for ways to help out in your community, sign up to volunteer with @WisDems. 
ENTP|Today is the first day of early voting in the Wisconsin Supreme Court election. Its going to be close, so don’t wait until April 4th. Make a plan to vote today and encourage your family and friends to do the same. Find your early vote location 
ENTP|Here’s an example of a smart policy that gets rid of unnecessary college degree requirements and reduces barriers to good paying jobs. I hope other states follow suit! 
ENTP|From the O’Bama family to yours, Happy St. Patrick’s Day! 
ENTP|It’s the best time of year! My #MarchMadness brackets will get busted soon enough, but here are my picks. Who do you have winning it all? 
ENTP|Im incredibly proud and inspired by @BSW5020 and @Sabrevaya, their family, and the movement theyve brought together to fight ALS. Theyve taken an incredibly challenging moment and are driving change. And theyre not done yet.
ENTP|For Womens History Month, I wanted to share the stories of Cary and Sharika—two women whove been building the Obama Presidential Center on the South Side of Chicago. I met them last year while visiting the site. Read their stories here 
ENTP|.@DemRedistrict hasn’t just been fighting for fair maps — they’ve been fighting to give people everywhere a fair shot. Our democracy is stronger today because of their hard work. 
ENTP|This International Womens Day, read how @MichelleObama, @MelindaGates and Amal Clooney are working together to help end child marriage. Im proud of the work @GirlsAlliance is doing to take on issues like this to create a better world for girls everywhere. 
ENTP|Judy Heumann dedicated her life to the fight for civil rights—starting as a young organizer at Camp Jened and later helping lead the disability rights movement. Michelle and I were fortunate to work with Judy over the years, and are thinking of her family and friends. 
ENTP|Fired up. Ready to go! Edith Childs understands the power of a single voice, and she used those words to light up a room during my campaign stop in Greenwood, SC back in 2007. I recently caught up with Edith, who just retired after 24 years in public service. Take a look 
ENTP|Real change happens one person, one community, one connection at a time. If you’re an emerging leader in Chicago, Detroit, or Jackson — I hope you’ll check out this new initiative to bring people from different backgrounds together to help solve local problems.
ENTP|I’m so proud of the work we’ve done at @MBKAlliance, and the young men who’ve been a part of this community. And were not done yet. We’ll keep working to make sure even more boys and young men reach their full potential.
ENTP|I’m excited to announce that 105 inspiring young people from across Africa, Asia-Pacific, and Europe will be joining the @ObamaFoundation Leaders program. I am so proud of all of you, and I cant wait to see what you do. 
ENTP|Dr. Blanks four years serving in my administration was just one part of her extraordinary life. Whether in government or academia, she devoted her career to reducing inequality and increasing opportunities for others, and made everyone around her better. 
ENTP|Happy Valentine’s Day to the one and only, @MichelleObama. You make every day feel like an adventure. 
ENTP|Congratulations to the Kansas City @Chiefs, Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce and Andy Reid for a great Super Bowl win and for sustained excellence. And shout out to the @Eagles and Jalen Hurts—outstanding competitors with a bright future.
ENTP|@KingJames has been changing the game for 20 years, and has become a leader on and off the court. Congrats on making history.
ENTP|The scale of devastation after the earthquakes in Türkiye and Syria is almost unimaginable. Michelle and I are thinking of the thousands of people who have been affected, including Syrian refugees. Here are some resources for anyone looking to help.
ENTP|At my last Black History Month celebration at the White House, we had folks of all ages come together to celebrate—including Clark Reynolds. I hope well continue to build a brighter future for young people like him. 
ENTP|Black History Month is about the shared experience of all Black Americans whose lives have shaped, challenged, and ultimately strengthened America.
ENTP|Along with mourning Tyre and supporting his family, it’s up to all of us to mobilize for lasting change. To learn more about how communities can reimagine public safety to prevent both crime and injustice, go to 
ENTP|The vicious, unjustified beating of Tyre Nichols and his ultimate death at the hands of five Memphis police officers is just the latest, painful reminder of how far America still has to go in fixing how we police our streets. 
ENTP|I asked Jeff Zients to handle some of our toughest challenges and, without fail, his leadership proved invaluable. He led my economic team as we pushed our most progressive economic policies, and I know he’ll serve @POTUS and the American people well in this new role.
ENTP|Being @WHCOS is never easy, but Ron Klain has done an outstanding job. From distributing millions of vaccines to passing a bipartisan infrastructure bill, Ron has helped @POTUS keep his promises.
ENTP|We believe that if young people who are passionate about public service get financial aid for college, exposure to travel, and the networks they need to make a difference, the skys the limit. I hope youll apply by March 22. 
ENTP|.@Bchesky and I were excited to meet with the inaugural class of Voyager Scholarship recipients at our Summit last year. And were proud to announce that applications for the second class of Voyagers are now open 
ENTP|I hope you’ll join with the activists who’ve been sounding the alarm on this issue for years — and act. Stand with them at a local protest. Volunteer with them on a campaign. Donate to their causes. And vote in every election for candidates who will support reproductive rights.
ENTP|On what would have been the 50th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, we’re reminded that progress can move backward. And that means we’ve got to recommit to doing our part to protect and expand reproductive rights for families today — and for generations to come.
ENTP|Prime Minister @JacindaArdern has guided New Zealand through crises and seized opportunities by leading with foresight, integrity and empathy. Her country is better off because of her remarkable leadership—and the rest of us are too. 
ENTP|Proud to see @SecBlinken visiting my hometown of Chicago! The Ukrainian community has always been a big part of what makes our city special—and today, with Ukraine on democracy’s frontline, thats as true as its ever been.
ENTP|All this while solidifying our alliances and offering a guiding hand during a time of increasing global conflict and upheaval. I’m grateful for all that President Biden and Vice President Harris have done for the American people. And I know they’re just getting started.
ENTP|And for the first time in nearly 30 years, Congress was able to pass significant gun safety legislation to help save lives.
ENTP|Under the leadership of the Biden-Harris administration, our economy has added more than 10.7 million jobs. President Biden also worked across the aisle to rebuild our infrastructure and invest in American manufacturing.
ENTP|They’ve strengthened the Affordable Care Act. They’ve lowered health care costs for seniors. They’ve capped the costs of insulin. They’ve distributed hundreds of millions of free vaccines.
ENTP|Today marks two years since the Biden-Harris administration began. I’ve been reflecting on how fortunate we’ve been to have the steady leadership of @POTUS and @VP—and all the public servants working to deliver for folks across the country. 
ENTP|Applications are now open for our new @ObamaFoundation Leaders USA program. Were looking for passionate emerging leaders from every corner of the country, ages 24 to 45, who are making an impact in their community. I hope youll apply by February 3 at 
ENTP|Happy birthday, @MichelleObama. You make every day brighter — and somehow keep looking better! 
ENTP|Today we pay tribute to the extraordinary life and legacy of Dr. King, and reflect on the lessons he taught us. Thanks to everyone who joined the @ObamaFoundation to lend a hand in Chicago. 
ENTP|If you need to get covered, head over to Open enrollment ends this Sunday, January 15.
ENTP|I’ll always be proud to have my name associated with a program that’s helping folks get the health care they need. 
ENTP|This week, Illinois joined states across the country in passing a historic gun violence prevention package. This would not have been possible without the work of grassroots organizers, survivors and their families, and lawmakers who channeled their anguish into bold action.
ENTP|If you havent already, I hope you’ll take some time to watch Descendant on @Netflix. Its an important documentary that shares the story of the descendants of the Clotilda, the last known ship carrying enslaved folks from Africa, as they uncover the truth about the past. 
ENTP|Last fall, visual artist Adam Davis captured tintype photos of the descendants of Africatown during the premiere of the @HGMedia documentary Descendant. He recently took one of me, too. These photos were inspired by the images taken of a Clotilda survivor, Cudjoe Lewis. 
ENTP|The entire world has a stake in the success of Brazil’s democracy. Together, we must reject any effort to overturn or disrupt the will of the Brazilian people and affirm the peaceful transfer of power as a cornerstone of democracy.
ENTP|15 years ago today, our campaign won the Iowa caucuses. I’ll always be grateful to the people who organized across the state, and built the relationships that made it all possible. I recently sat down with six organizers to talk about that time and what they’ve been up to since. 
ENTP|Happy New Year! In 2022, people around the world helped change their communities for the better. Lets keep it up in 2023. We’ve still got a lot of work to do, but I’ll be right there with you. Heres to a happy, healthy, and peaceful new year.
ENTP|The work the @ObamaFoundation did in 2022 makes me hopeful for the future. From supporting the next generation of leaders to strengthening democracy around the world, weve made a lot of progress this year. Take a look 
ENTP|Pelé was one of the greatest to ever play the beautiful game. And as one of the most recognizable athletes in the world, he understood the power of sports to bring people together. Our thoughts are with his family and everyone who loved and admired him. 
ENTP|Michelle and I send our best wishes to families celebrating Kwanzaa this holiday season. Today begins a week-long celebration of African-American heritage and culture. As folks gather to light the Kinara, we hope you have a happy Kwanzaa. 
ENTP|Merry Christmas, everybody! One of the best parts of the holiday season is getting to spend time with the special people in our lives. I hope you all have a wonderful and joyful Christmas. 
ENTP|I always enjoy sharing my end of year music playlist with all of you — and this year we heard a lot of great songs. Here are some of my favorites. Are there any songs or artists I should check out? 
ENTP|I saw some great movies this year – here are some of my favorites. What did I miss? 
ENTP|I always look forward to sharing my lists of favorite books, movies, and music with all of you. First up, here are some of the books I read and enjoyed this year. Let me know which books I should check out in 2023. 
ENTP|I grew up watching Franco Harris, and had the honor of getting to know him years later. He was an extraordinary man on and off the field, and will be missed. Our thoughts go out to his family and all of Steeler Nation.
ENTP|Congrats to Argentina and to the GOAT, Lionel Messi, for an amazing World Cup victory.
ENTP|Michelle and I send our warmest wishes to everyone celebrating Hanukkah. At a time when antisemitism is on the rise around the world, let’s remember that the light of hope will always shine brighter than hate. From my family to yours, Chag Sameach!
ENTP|But in the 10 years since, the families of Sandy Hook have taken unimaginable sorrow and channeled it into a righteous cause—setting an example of strength and resolve. Take a moment to learn more about them and how you can help at 
ENTP|I consider December 14th, 2012 the single darkest day of my presidency. The news from Sandy Hook Elementary was devastating, a visceral blow, and like so many others, I felt not just sorrow but anger at a world that could allow such things to happen. 
ENTP|It’s a landmark moment in the fight for equality, and a tribute to the generations of Americans whose example and advocacy have done more than any law to change hearts and minds. This is their victory, and a powerful reminder that, together, we can continue to perfect our union.
ENTP|By mandating the federal recognition of same-sex marriages, the Respect for Marriage Act brings us closer to preserving the fundamental right of every American to marry who they love.
ENTP|In 2015, when the Supreme Court recognized the Constitutional right to marriage equality, I said that progress often comes in small increments. Then there are days when slow, steady effort is rewarded with justice that arrives like a thunderbolt. Today is one of those days.
ENTP|Grateful for the long-overdue release of Brittney Griner today from Russian custody. Kudos to @POTUS and his administration for the difficult diplomatic work involved to make it happen. We’re looking forward to having Brittney back home.
ENTP|Once again, Georgians have proven that when it comes time to vote, they’ll show up and vote for a leader who will fight for them. Congratulations, @ReverendWarnock!
ENTP|Vote for @ReverendWarnock. Vote today to build on the work of people like John Lewis and Ann Nixon Cooper who paved the way for us. Vote to build a better future for the next generation. 
ENTP|Georgia, it’s time to get out and vote to re-elect @ReverendWarnock. Make sure to get your family, friends, and neighbors out to vote, too. Find your polling location at 
ENTP|Georgia — vote for @ReverendWarnock! Make a plan to vote today at 
ENTP|Affordable health care is a right, not a privilege. If you havent already, make sure to sign up for health care during this open enrollment period. Go to today to pick a plan that works best for you and your family.
ENTP|That’s why Im asking every Georgian to get out and vote for Reverend Warnock. Then get everybody you know to vote. We cant get tired now. Make a plan to vote today at 
ENTP|.@ReverendWarnock is a hard-working, God-fearing, community-serving leader who tells the truth, sticks to his word, and treats everybody with decency and respect. He’ll keep making Georgia proud in the Senate. 
ENTP|I’m back in Georgia to deliver a simple message Vote to re-elect @ReverendWarnock. Tune in 
ENTP|If youre not from Georgia, you can still get involved in this election by making calls, chipping in if you can, and reaching out to your family and friends in Georgia and reminding them to vote. Let’s all do our part to re-elect @ReverendWarnock. 
ENTP|Georgia! Let’s do this one more time. We need everybody to show up and vote to send @ReverendWarnock back to the Senate. Go to to find your polling place and make a plan to vote early.
ENTP|Michelle and I started the @ObamaFoundation to support the next generation of leaders who are picking up the baton and creating sustainable change in their communities. On Giving Tuesday, Im asking you to help keep their work going 
ENTP|Last month, I spoke with some of the incredible small business leaders working on the South and West sides of Chicago. As we build the Obama Presidential Center, we’ll work closely with these businesses and hope the Center helps boost economic growth across the city. 
ENTP|One of my favorite White House traditions was telling Thanksgiving jokes – which at least I thought were funny. Here’s a look back at some of my favorites 
ENTP|Wishing everyone a happy Thanksgiving! As we celebrate, lets give thanks for all the blessings in our lives and give back when we can. We’re also thinking of the brave men and women serving our country far from their home.
ENTP|But voters in some states—including Florida, Texas, and Wisconsin—are still affected by gerrymandering. That’s why we’ve got to stay in the fight and keep working to stop partisan gerrymandering once and for all. Join us 
ENTP|Thanks in part to the NDRC, states that were once gerrymandered by Republicans—Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Colorado, Minnesota—are now highly competitive. And that’s how it should be—voters should choose their representatives, not the other way around.
ENTP|One reason the balance of power in the House of Representatives is so close is because, for the first time in a decade, there were enough competitive districts at play. Thanks to the work of @DemRedistrict, Americans voted on the fairest congressional map of the last 40 years.
ENTP|We can and must do more to reduce gun violence in America. 
ENTP|I’m inspired by the next generation of leaders—especially those who joined us last week at our @ObamaFoundation Democracy Forum. Their ideas and insights will help strengthen democracy, and carry it into the future. Take a look back at our day together 
ENTP|Best of luck to @USMNT at the World Cup! Michelle and I are incredibly proud of what you’ve accomplished so far, and we’ll be rooting for you all the way.
ENTP|Happy birthday, @JoeBiden! There’s a lot to celebrate these days, and I couldn’t be more grateful that America has you sitting behind the desk. 
ENTP|Yesterday @BChesky and I had the chance to meet with our inaugural recipients of The Voyager Scholarship. Michelle, Brian, and I can’t wait to work with these talented young people over the next few years as they pursue careers in public service. 
ENTP|Our @ObamaFoundation Leaders are working hard to tackle some of our toughest challenges. It was great having some of them join @TrevorNoah and me on @TheDailyShow to share more about their work. 
ENTP|I’m happy to announce that we’ll be launching a new and expanded Leaders United States program in the coming months that can help more young people put their idealism to work. Michelle and I are proud to support these young leaders through our work at the Obama Foundation. 
ENTP|Today at the @ObamaFoundation Democracy Forum, we brought leaders from around the world together to share ideas and discuss ways to strengthen democracy. 
ENTP|Im in New York City for the @ObamaFoundation’s #DemocracyForum with leaders from around the world to discuss how we can strengthen our democracy and support the next generation of leaders working on some of our most important challenges. Tune in 
ENTP|Speaker Nancy Pelosi will go down as one of most accomplished legislators in American history—breaking barriers, opening doors for others, and working every day to serve the American people. I couldn’t be more grateful for her friendship and leadership. 
ENTP|But the fight to protect DACA recipients remains unfinished. Earlier this year I sat down with a group of Dreamers, whose stories speak to all the ways in which they strengthen our communities. Congress should act now and resolve their status once and for all.
ENTP|Some good news from Arizona voters approved a ballot initiative that will make Dreamers eligible for in-state tuition. Credit goes to the organizers who shared their families stories and assembled a bipartisan coalition of supporters. 
ENTP|Rest in peace, Virginia. We know you’re up there dancing. 
ENTP|Among @MichelleObamas many talents is the fact that she is a fantastic writer. In her new book, The Light We Carry, she shares the tools and lessons she’s learned that help her navigate times of uncertainty. Its a book youll want to go back to over and over again.
ENTP|Congratulations to all the organizers and volunteers in South Dakota on the results last week – and to all those whose work to expand Medicaid has made it possible for millions of Americans to access health care.
ENTP|It’s why we pushed so hard for the ACA – because health care should be a right, not a privilege. But just as important, it’s a testament to what can happen when citizens are willing to grab some clipboards, get some signatures, and build a coalition to bring about change.
ENTP|Last week, voters in South Dakota chose to expand access to Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, making it possible for more than 40,000 South Dakotans to access health care. With this good news, 39 states have now expanded Medicaid since 2012. 
ENTP|Getting the right folks in these jobs – and many others – was an important step. But we can’t rest. We need to keep speaking out against dangerous candidates, keep supporting good ones, and keep voting up and down the ballot. Our democracy depends on it.
ENTP|.@AdrianFontes was just elected Secretary of State in Arizona. Adrian’s opponent was at the Capitol on January 6th, and suggested he might reject Democratic votes in the future. Adrian believes every vote should count, and now he’ll be able to make it happen in Arizona.
ENTP|.@JocelynBenson has been doing a great job as Michigan’s Secretary of State. She was just re-elected, and will continue to make sure every Michiganders vote counts in every election.
ENTP|Lets celebrate Democratic candidates like @CiscoForNevada, who will be Nevada’s next Secretary of State. His opponent spread conspiracy theories and lies about voting machines. Cisco will protect the integrity of Nevada’s elections.
ENTP|I cant emphasize enough how much Secretary of State races matter. They don’t always get the most attention, but they’re crucial to ensuring we have fair elections—and this time, voters across the country chose candidates who will fight for democracy.
ENTP|Thanks to all those who have proudly served our country in uniform, and the families who have served alongside them. We owe you so much—on Veterans Day, and every day.
ENTP|For democracy to thrive, we need to tell better stories about ourselves, and how we can live together despite our differences. On November 17th, Ill be joining global leaders working to protect democracy at our @ObamaFoundation #DemocracyForum. 
ENTP|In this election, millions of people cast their ballots for an America that is more fair, more just, more equal, and more free. We’re not there yet, but this keeps us moving forward. Our democracy is resilient as long as we stay engaged and active between elections.
ENTP|Midterm elections matter. Don’t let anyone convince you that your vote won’t make a difference. Show up at the polls today and vote for Democrats up and down the ballot. 
ENTP|The kind of slash and burn politics that we’re seeing right now, that doesn’t have to be who we are. We can be better – and your vote tomorrow will help us get there. 
ENTP|A simple message from @JoeBiden and me Vote! 
ENTP|Let’s get this done. Go to today to make a plan to vote.
ENTP|Our democracy is on the ballot. If we want to build on the progress that @JoeBiden and Democrats have made so far, then we’re going to need everybody to make their voices heard on Tuesday. Show up. Vote on November 8th. Encourage your friends, family, neighbors to join you. 
ENTP|The more things change, the more things stay the same. I’m just as proud to stand—and look short—beside this guy today as I was back then. Pennsylvania, it’s time to show up and vote for @JohnFetterman for Senate! 
ENTP|I’m fired up to be in Philadelphia with my friend @JoeBiden to make sure everybody turns out to vote in this election. Tune in live. 
ENTP|Pennsylvania, make sure you vote for @JoshShapiroPA for Governor, @SummerForPA and @ChrisForPA for the U.S. House, and @JohnFetterman for the U.S. Senate. Theyll work to make a difference for folks like you. Make a plan to vote at 
ENTP|We only have three days left until Election Day. Tune in as I share why it’s important to support Democratic candidates up and down the ballot in Pennsylvania. 
ENTP|The only way to make our democracy stronger is if we fight for it. And that starts by electing people who know you, who see you, and who understand what you’re going through. So vote for Democrats up and down the ballot on Election Day.
ENTP|When we break down barriers and expose young people to new pathways to success there’s no limit to what they can accomplish. That’s the driving idea behind the @MBKAlliance program at the @ObamaFoundation. Looking forward to seeing where these young men go next. 
ENTP|This election could set the direction of our country for years to come. It’s that important. So make your voice heard by voting early or on November 8th. Go to to make a plan.
ENTP|Arizona, you have a chance to vote for candidates like @KrisMayes, @AdrianFontes, @KatieHobbs, and @CaptMarkKelly who will work to build the inclusive, hopeful, forward-looking America we believe in. 
ENTP|I’m in Arizona today to support Democratic candidates who will fight for you. Tune in now.

ENTP|Georgia, I’m here today for a simple reason to ask you to vote. Because, once again, this is not an ordinary election. The stakes are higher. So vote for Democratic candidates who will fight for you.

ENTP|I heard there was a group of students from across Chicago getting together with Don C. and @AyoDos11, so I thought I’d stop by. I’m proud of this group, and know they’ll do big things! 
ENTP|Michelle and I voted early today. Now it’s your turn. Check your voter registration or update it at then make a plan to vote early or on Election Day. Because every vote matters. 
ENTP|I sat down with @PodSaveAmerica to talk about the importance of voting in these midterms, the state of democracy here and abroad, and the progress Democrats have made on the issues that matter. Take a listen 
ENTP|If we want our democracy to function, we have to show up this election for the Governors, Secretaries of State and the candidates down the ballot who are going to protect voting rights and our electoral process. Because these seats wield a lot of power, and that power matters. 
ENTP|It was great speaking with Imani and Austin, two outstanding @UrbanAlliance Obama Youth Jobs Corps students. They’re proof that when we connect young people with training and meaningful work experience, it benefits our communities and the world. 
ENTP|Congrats to @JHUAPL on confirming we successfully moved an asteroid! The historic DART mission proved humanity could stop a threatening asteroid if needed — and shows what’s possible when we come together and do big things.
ENTP|On this International Day of the Girl, we stand in solidarity with the courageous Iranian women and girls who have inspired the world through their ongoing protests. 
ENTP|Her commitment to supporting and training the next generation of Indigenous women and girls looking to study science, technology, engineering, and math is inspiring. I hope you’ll take a moment to read her story and learn more about her work.

ENTP|This November, I’ll be joining @ObamaFoundation leaders to discuss how we can adapt democracies and our institutions for a new age. Find out more 
ENTP|At a time when democracy is under threat around the world, what gives me hope is the potential of the next generation of leaders. I couldn’t be more excited to announce the @ObamaFoundation’s global convening focused on the ideas that are essential to our democracy.
ENTP|And here are some ways to support folks who’ve been impacted by Hurricane Fiona 
ENTP|If you’re looking for ways to help, the @ObamaFoundation has compiled a list of organizations doing work to help those impacted by Hurricane Ian 
ENTP|Michelle and I are thinking of everyone affected by Hurricane Ian and Hurricane Fiona. Were grateful to the first responders and volunteers who are doing everything they can to help those in need.
ENTP|At a time when the meaning of America is up for grabs, @CodyKeenan’s new book chronicles ten days that tested us and ultimately showed us at our best. It’s a captivating story about what’s worth fighting for, an antidote to cynicism that will make you believe again. 
ENTP|Miche, After 30 years, I’m not sure why you look exactly the same and I don’t. I do know that I won the lottery that day—that I couldn’t have asked for a better life partner. Happy anniversary, sweetheart! 
ENTP|Happy 98th birthday, President Carter! Your dedication to public service and the work you and the @CarterCenter have done to lift up others is an example we should all follow. 
ENTP|I got my start on the South Side of Chicago, right down the street from where we’re building the Center, and the lessons I learned in these neighborhoods ended up shaping my life. The Obama Presidential Center is our way of paying it forward. 
ENTP|It’s been one year since we officially broke ground on the Obama Presidential Center, and I couldn’t be prouder of the progress we’ve made so far. 
ENTP|This summer, @MBKAlliance awarded grants to 51 organizations working hard to make a difference for young boys and men of color across the country. You can learn more about them here

ENTP|We also owe a debt of gratitude to the team at the Brooklyn Library, and everyone who is helping make sure that readers across the country have access to great books. 
ENTP|I’m grateful for people like Cameron who fought censorship in Texas by organizing a student-led movement that eventually distributed more than 700 challenged or banned books. 
ENTP|Im thankful for leaders like Rebecca, one of our @ObamaFoundation Scholars, and Iesha who are making sure Chicagoans of all ages have access to powerful literature. 
ENTP|This year, I’m celebrating Banned Books Week and the freedom to read with people across the country. I wrote out a few of my thoughts, and wanted to share the stories of some folks who are working on this issue. 
ENTP|Today, books that shaped my life—and many others—are being challenged in schools, bookstores, and libraries by people who disagree with certain ideas or perspectives. Often, these banned books are written by or feature people of color and members of LGBTQ communities.
ENTP|These are just a few of the questions that will be answered at the ballot box—which is why it’s so important to make sure youre registered to vote. After youve checked, make sure to ask your family, friends, and neighbors to do the same.
ENTP|In a few weeks, well get to decide who we want to be. Do we want to be a nation that protects womens rights? A nation that allows every citizen to make their voice heard? A nation that takes action on climate change before it’s too late?
ENTP|Voting is the cornerstone of our democracy—and, as the late Congressman John Lewis reminded us, our most precious right. On National Voter Registration Day, take a few minutes to make sure youre registered at Then make a plan to vote.
ENTP|Michelle and I were lucky enough to know Her Majesty The Queen. Back when we were just beginning to navigate life as President and First Lady, she welcomed us to the world stage with extraordinary generosity. Our thoughts are with the Royal Family and those mourning her passing. 
ENTP|Congratulations to the @LVAces on their first WNBA title! It’s been fun to watch Coach @BeckyHammon and this team play this season.
ENTP|This article is a reminder of how focused government action can make a real difference in our kids’ lives. We can do more to make sure every child has a fair shot. 
ENTP|The Inflation Reduction Act will lower the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs, while also taking important steps to protect our planet. @POTUS and @VP continue to deliver for the American people—and that’s worth celebrating.
ENTP|Michelle and I are proud to join @BChesky in announcing the first recipients of The Voyager Scholarship, which supports 100 rising college juniors as they pursue a career in public service. I can’t wait to see what these young people accomplish! 
ENTP|I heard about the work that Coach Amaker and the young people at Harvard are doing to build community, so I decided to drop by one of their meetings. Thanks for letting me be an honorary member of The Breakfast Club!
ENTP|Last week, Michelle and I unveiled our official White House portraits by Robert McCurdy and Sharon Sprung. Take a look as we reflect on what that moment meant to us 
ENTP|Today, we remember the nearly 3,000 lives we lost on September 11, 2001. We honor their memory, the courage of our first responders, and the men and women in uniform who continue to keep us safe. 
ENTP|Like so many of you, Michelle and I are grateful to have witnessed Her Majesty’s dedicated leadership, and we are awed by her legacy of tireless, dignified public service. Our thoughts are with her family and the people of the United Kingdom at this difficult time. 
ENTP|When future generations see these portraits by Robert McCurdy and Sharon Sprung in the White House, I hope they get a better, honest sense of who Michelle and I were. And I hope they leave with a deeper understanding that if we could make it, they can do remarkable things, too. 
ENTP|I want to thank Robert McCurdy for his extraordinary work on my portrait. Robert is known for his paintings of public figures, and I love how he paints people exactly the way they are. Take a look at the process behind creating the official White House portraits 
ENTP|Labor Day is about celebrating the working class men and women whose grit and resilience built our country and made our economic progress possible. They’ve raised their voices, advocated for better working conditions, and kept our country going.
ENTP|Congratulations, Serena, for your heart, skill, intelligence, dedication, and grace. Few athletes have inspired more people both in and beyond their sport!
ENTP|Young leaders like our @ObamaFoundation Scholars give me hope for a brighter future. Our newest Scholars are working on issues like climate change, mass incarceration, and gender-based violence. I cant wait to see the difference they make together.
ENTP|But our work isn’t finished. Now we need folks to actually vote – not just to build on the progress we’ve made, but to protect our democracy. Make a plan to vote and visit to learn how you can get involved.
ENTP|Over the last few years, the National Democratic Redistricting Committee has organized volunteers and activists to keep Republicans from redrawing electoral maps in their favor. And it worked. This fall, voters will have the fairest maps in a generation.
ENTP|Thanks to @EricHolder and @DemRedistrict, more voters will be able to choose their politicians in this next election instead of the other way around. And what better way to celebrate that progress than to hear from @JohnLegend, @iamwill, and @JayPharoah. 
ENTP|Congratulations to Hawaii for cruising to their fourth Little League World Series title! Im so proud of this team. 🤙🏾
ENTP|This is life changing news for millions of borrowers working to pay back their student loans. Its also a testament to @POTUS, his administration, and all the activists whove been calling for student debt relief for years.
ENTP|I will always be grateful that we had a once-in-a-century public health leader to guide us through a once-in-a-century pandemic. Few people have touched more lives than Dr. Fauci – and I’m glad he’s not done yet.
ENTP|This is a great way to encourage fans to vote on Election Day.
ENTP|This is a BFD.
ENTP|Signing up to be a poll worker is one of the most effective things you can do to help make sure our democracy works—and to push back against anyone who tries to spread confusion and chaos on Election Day. Learn more at 
ENTP|With the midterms coming up, we need to recruit poll workers who are willing to serve in communities across the country. This Poll Worker Recruitment Day, @AllOnTheLine and @PowerThePolls are partnering to make sure elections everywhere are safe, fair, and efficient.
ENTP|There’s a lot to digest in the Inflation Reduction Act, but don’t miss this part starting in 2025, people on Medicare will save hundreds or even thousands of dollars a year on their prescriptions. 
ENTP|Here’s the truth @danpfeiffer’s latest book, Battling the Big Lie, is an important read for anyone who’s wondering how the far right traffics in lies and what we can all do to fight back. As we head into election season, it could not be more timely. 
ENTP|Thanks to President Biden and Democrats in Congress, people’s bills will get smaller, their lives will get longer, and we’ll have a real shot at avoiding the worst impacts of climate change. That’s something Democrats everywhere can and should be proud of.
ENTP|The Inflation Reduction Act that just passed the Senate is a major accomplishment. Not only will it reduce inflation and lower the cost of prescription drugs – it also happens to be the most consequential piece of climate legislation in American history. 
ENTP|Thanks to the members of our Obama Alumni family whose generosity helped bring this incredible project to life. I can’t wait for you to see it.
ENTP|The Ann Dunham Water Garden will be a special place for visitors and members of the community to reflect. It will also feature an incredible new sculpture by Maya Lin, whose work Ive long admired.
ENTP|My mother, Ann Dunham, was the biggest influence on my life, and helped shape me into the person I am today. I’m proud to share that the Water Garden at the Obama Presidential Center will be named in her honor. 
ENTP|You bet, Joe. 31 million folks enrolled and the lowest uninsured rate ever. Now Congress needs to pass the Inflation Reduction Act to build on this progress.
ENTP|Tonight’s news is also proof that it’s possible to root out terrorism without being at war in Afghanistan. And I hope it provides a small measure of peace to the 9/11 families and everyone else who has suffered at the hands of al-Qaeda.
ENTP|It’s a tribute to President Biden’s leadership, to the members of the intelligence community who have been working for decades for this moment, and to the counterterrorism professionals who were able to take al-Zawahiri out without a single civilian casualty.
ENTP|More than 20 years after 9/11, one of the masterminds of that terrorist attack and Osama bin Laden’s successor as the leader of al-Qaeda – Ayman al-Zawahiri – has finally been brought to justice.
ENTP|For decades, Bill endured insults and vandalism, but never let it stop him from speaking up for what’s right. I learned so much from the way he played, the way he coached, and the way he lived his life. Michelle and I send our love to Bill’s family, and everyone who admired him.
ENTP|Perhaps more than anyone else, Bill knew what it took to win and what it took to lead. On the court, he was the greatest champion in basketball history. Off of it, he was a civil rights trailblazer—marching with Dr. King and standing with Muhammad Ali.
ENTP|Today, we lost a giant. As tall as Bill Russell stood, his legacy rises far higher—both as a player and as a person.
ENTP|I’m grateful to President Biden and those in Congress – Democrat or Republican – who are working to deliver for the American people. Progress doesn’t always happen all at once, but it does happen – and this is what it looks like.
ENTP|Then President Biden and Democrats in Congress announced a deal that will fight inflation by reducing the cost of prescription drugs, cutting the deficit, and making the biggest investments in history to boost clean energy and tackle the climate crisis.
ENTP|This has been a big week for the Biden Administration and Democrats in Congress. First, Congress is on track to pass a bipartisan bill that will lower the cost of everything from cars to consumer goods, and make us less dependent on foreign semiconductors.
ENTP|I can’t wait for you to hear The Sum of Us podcast from @HGMedia. @HMcGhee travels across the country to highlight the extraordinary stories of Americans working to build a better future, and the connections between them. Take a listen now on Spotify.
ENTP|Every year, I get excited to share my summer playlist because I learn about so many new artists from your replies—it’s an example of how music really can bring us all together. Here’s what I’ve been listening to this summer. What songs would you add? 
ENTP|I’ve read a couple of great books this year and wanted to share some of my favorites so far. What have you been reading this summer? 
ENTP|There is so much power in telling our story, sharing our truth, and inviting others into our lives. I’m so proud of @MichelleObama for doing just that in her new book, The Light We Carry, and can’t wait for you to read it.
ENTP|Ahead of Mandela Day, I spoke with the talented young people who just completed our @ObamaFoundation Leaders Africa program. They’ve been working on some of the most pressing issues across the continent, and are working together to find solutions. I couldn’t be prouder of them. 
ENTP|John Lewis and Reverend C.T. Vivian dedicated their lives to fighting for freedom and equality. They believed we could remake this country until it lived up to its full promise, and now it’s up to all of us to follow in their footsteps.
ENTP|These new images from the @NASAWebb Space Telescope are mind-blowing. Congratulations to everybody who made this possible—I’m excited to see more!
ENTP|Michelle and I send our deepest condolences to the people of Japan who are very much in our thoughts at this painful moment.
ENTP|I will always remember the work we did to strengthen our alliance, the moving experience of traveling to Hiroshima and Pearl Harbor together, and the grace he and his wife Akie Abe showed to me and Michelle.
ENTP|I am shocked and saddened by the assassination of my friend and longtime partner Shinzo Abe in Japan. Former Prime Minister Abe was devoted to both the country he served and the extraordinary alliance between the United States and Japan.
ENTP|Right now, thousands of Ukrainian families are hoping to connect with American sponsors. Help them rebuild their lives by registering to become a sponsor with @WelcomeUS at 
ENTP|Michelle and I mourn the passing of Clifford Alexander. He was an extraordinary public servant—who became the first African American Secretary of the Army—and an even better friend. We miss him already.
ENTP|Happy birthday, Malia! No matter how sophisticated, accomplished, beautiful, and gracious a young woman you’ve become—you’ll always be my baby. And I will always be here to lift you up. 
ENTP|Happy Fourth of July! As we celebrate today, lets thank our armed forces and their families for their service to our country. And lets recommit to fighting for our democracy—theres still so much work to be done to perfect our union.
ENTP|The Stonewall Uprising helped galvanize a movement for LGBTQ+ rights. The progress we’ve made in the years since is a testament to what happens when people organize and demand change. But we need to do more to safeguard LGBTQ+ rights and expand on those hard-earned victories.
ENTP|In 2016, I was proud to designate the Stonewall National Monument as the first national monument to tell the story of the struggle for LGBTQ+ rights.
ENTP|Climate change is no longer just about the future that were trying to protect for our children or our grandchildren, its about the reality were living with now. That’s why it’s more urgent now than ever before that Congress pass @POTUS’ climate and clean energy investments.
ENTP|The 6-3 decision strikes a blow to the EPA’s authority to regulate power plant emissions—paving the way to dismantle some of the most impactful provisions of the Clean Air Act and limit our ability to reduce carbon pollution.
ENTP|No challenge poses a greater threat to our future than a changing climate. Every day, we’re feeling the impact of climate change, and today’s Supreme Court decision is a major step backward.
ENTP|As president, I saw Chancellor Merkel lead through crises with her wise pragmatism, good humor, and unrelenting moral compass—and I feel lucky to call her a friend. Grateful for the chance to visit the @NMAAHC today, a reminder that America is a constant work in progress. 
ENTP|Last week, I stopped by the Obama Presidential Center construction site. It’s great to see this dream start to come to life on the South Side and to meet some of the extraordinary people who are helping to build it. 
ENTP|For more than a month, we’ve known this day was coming—but that doesn’t make it any less devastating. Here are my thoughts from when we first saw the draft ruling 
ENTP|Across the country, states have already passed bills restricting choice. If youre looking for ways to respond, @PPFA, @USOWomen, and many other groups have been sounding the alarm on this issue for years—and will continue to be on the front lines of this fight. 
ENTP|Today, the Supreme Court not only reversed nearly 50 years of precedent, it relegated the most intensely personal decision someone can make to the whims of politicians and ideologues—attacking the essential freedoms of millions of Americans.
ENTP|Progress isn’t always a straight line. Today’s Supreme Court decision is wrong but Congress passing the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act is a modest but real step forward. And the fight will go on, thanks to the activists, survivors, and families who continue to demand action.
ENTP|50 years ago, committed women and girls from around the country worked with Congress to pass Title IX and equal the playing field. @ESPNs 37 Words documentary looks into the impact of Title IX and the work still in front of us. 
ENTP|Michelle and I started the @ObamaFoundations Futures Series to connect the young leaders of tomorrow with the trailblazers of today. It’s great to see the impact that it’s already having on students from the South Side.
ENTP|Great news for parents The COVID-19 vaccine is approved for kids under 5. As appointments ramp up, you’ll be able to find a vaccine at pediatricians’ offices, pharmacies, and more. Its safe and effective—this is another big step to protect our loved ones and communities.
ENTP|On World Refugee Day, we recognize the challenges that refugees face, honor their courage, and celebrate their contributions to our country. If you would like to welcome refugees as your neighbors, join @WelcomeUS 
ENTP|Happy Fathers Day to all the dads and father-figures celebrating today! Of all that I’ve done in my life, I’m most proud of being Malia and Sashas dadand the familys designated photographer. 
ENTP|Today, I hope you’ll take some time to celebrate and learn more about Juneteenth. Here are some ways to recognize this important day. 
ENTP|We remember that even in the darkest hours, there is cause to hope for tomorrow’s light. Let us all recommit ourselves today to honoring those who fought over generations to steer our country closer to our highest ideals.
ENTP|Juneteenth is a time to commemorate the anniversary of the delayed news of freedom reaching the enslaved Black folks in Galveston, Texas. Today, we remember that struggle for freedom as we reflect on how far we’ve come as a country—and on the work that remains undone.
ENTP|With four championships in eight years, the @Warriors leave no doubt of their place as one of the NBA’s greatest dynasties. Congrats to Finals MVP Steph, Draymond, Klay, Coach Kerr and the rest of Dub Nation for such sustained excellence.
ENTP|Congrats to @USMonastirBB for winning the 2022 Basketball Africa League Finals. Youve inspired countless young people across Africa and around the world with your grit and determination this season. Its exciting to see the game we all love expand throughout the continent. 
ENTP|We need to build democracy for the future—and what gives me hope is the promise and potential of the next generation of leaders coming up. In Copenhagen last week, I had the chance to meet some of those young folks working with the @ObamaFoundation. 
ENTP|If were going to protect our democracy, we need to keep up the fight for fair maps. @DemRedistrict is at the forefront of that effort—and we need to help them build on the progress theyve already made protecting our free and fair elections 
ENTP|For the 10th anniversary of DACA, I met with these inspiring young people who shared their stories, the impact that DACA had on their lives, and the work that remains to support them. 
ENTP|For all they have done for our nation, and all they will continue to do, DACA recipients and their families deserve better. On the 10th anniversary of DACA, lets redouble our efforts to build a commonsense immigration system that offers these Americans a pathway to citizenship. 
ENTP|Im inspired by the @ObamaFoundation leaders I met today. These young people understand that the future of democracy hangs in the balance—and they’re ready to do the work. 
ENTP|Read more in my speech about how we can renew democracy by promoting more inclusive markets, political participation, community building, and less polarizing technology platforms. 
ENTP|And we will also have to be willing to look squarely at the shortcomings of our own democracies—not the ideal, but the reality. Only then will we be able to tell a better story of what democracy can be, and must be, in this rapidly changing world.
ENTP|The point is, if we want democracy to flourish, we will have to fight for it. We will have to nurture it. We will have to demonstrate its value, again and again, in improving the lives of ordinary people.
ENTP|In my own country, the forces that unleashed mob violence on our Capitol are still churning out misinformation and conspiracy theories. For those of us who fervently believe in the ideals of democracy, the question is How do we respond?
ENTP|Just as disturbing, within democracies, populist appeals grounded in fear, bigotry, and resentment have elevated leaders who, once they’re in office, have sought to systematically undermine democratic institutions and entrench themselves in power.
ENTP|On every continent, emboldened autocrats are ramping up oppression, they’re targeting minority groups, they’re often flouting international law.
ENTP|Yesterday, I spoke at the Copenhagen Democracy Summit to discuss the challenges to democracy around the world, and the work we can do right now with the next generation of leaders to chart a better course. 
ENTP|Happy birthday, Sasha! I have loved watching you grow into the intelligent, beautiful, and caring young woman youve become. And no matter how old you get—youll always be my baby girl. Look at those cheeks! 
ENTP|Tomorrow, Ill be speaking at the Copenhagen Democracy Summit. At a time like this, what gives me hope is the promise and potential of the next generation of leaders—who understand that democracy hangs in the balance and are ready to do what they can to save it. Take a look

ENTP|.@BChesky and I recently spoke with some young people about how the Voyager Scholarship will help students pursue careers in public service. Learn more and apply by June 14 
ENTP|Today, I’m joining those around the world in celebrating Her Majesty The Queen’s Platinum Jubilee. It is with gratitude for your leadership and the kindness you’ve shown me and my family that I say, may the light of your crown continue to reign supreme. 
ENTP|In the aftermath of Uvalde’s preventable tragedy, many of us are asking why Congress seems unable to act. This article provides a useful primer on how the Senate filibuster makes progress on this and other issues difficult, and why it needs to be changed. 
ENTP|On Memorial Day, we honor the memory of those who made the ultimate sacrifice for our country, and pray for their families—who still love and grieve for them. May God bless our fallen heroes and all who serve. 
ENTP|Jacob Philadelphia was five years old when he visited the Oval Office and asked if his hair was like mine. That photo became one of our favorites – a reminder of the power of seeing yourself in your leaders. Today, hes graduating from high school! Check out our recent reunion. 
ENTP|Inspired by these young leaders, @MBKAlliance launched a Reimagining Policing Pledge for mayors and cities ready to take action. If you’re wondering how you can help make things a little better today, here are some ways to get involved 
ENTP|In the aftermath of his murder, a new generation of activists rose up to channel their anguish into organized action, launching a movement to raise awareness of systemic racism and the need for criminal justice and police reform.
ENTP|As we grieve the children of Uvalde today, we should take time to recognize that two years have passed since the murder of George Floyd under the knee of a police officer. His killing stays with us all to this day, especially those who loved him.
ENTP|May God bless the memory of the victims, and in the words of Scripture, heal the brokenhearted and bind up their wounds.
ENTP|It’s long past time for action, any kind of action. And it’s another tragedy—a quieter but no less tragic one—for families to wait another day.
ENTP|Michelle and I grieve with the families in Uvalde, who are experiencing pain no one should have to bear.
ENTP|Across the country, parents are putting their children to bed, reading stories, singing lullabies—and in the back of their minds, they’re worried about what might happen tomorrow after they drop their kids off at school, or take them to a grocery store or any other public space.
ENTP|Getting vaccinated and boosted remains one of the most important things we can do to protect ourselves and the ones we love. If you havent already, find a shot at a vaccination location near you at 
ENTP|Weve now lost one million Americans to COVID-19. Its an unfathomable loss – these folks were our parents and grandparents, our sisters and brothers. 
ENTP|It’s despicable, it’s dangerous — and it needs to stop. 
ENTP|We need to repudiate in the strongest terms the politicians and media figures who — whether for political gain or to boost ratings — have used their platforms to promote and normalize replacement theory and other starkly racist, anti-Semitic, and nativist conspiracy theories.
ENTP|This weekend’s shootings in Buffalo offer a tragic reminder of the price we pay for refusing to curb the easy access to guns. It should also serve as a wakeup call for all Americans of goodwill, regardless of party.
ENTP|I’m proud to announce the Voyager Scholarship with my friend @bchesky. We hope to provide young people with an interest in public service with some financial support to graduate college, exposure to travel, and the networks they need to make a difference. 
ENTP|If you cant join a march in person today, you can still get involved. Donate to a local abortion fund. Volunteer with activists who’ve been organizing on this issue for years. And vote on or before November 8 and in every election. Take action 
ENTP|Across the country, Americans are standing up for abortion rights—and I’m proud of everyone making their voices heard. Join a march near you 
ENTP|I’m a Hawai’i kid, so I’ve got to congratulate the Rainbow Warriors for their back-to-back national volleyball championships! @HawaiiMensVB, youve made all of Hawaii proud. 
ENTP|Happy Mothers Day! I hope you all let the moms and mother-figures in your life know how much they mean to you. @MichelleObama, thank you for being a wonderful mother and role model to our daughters and to so many others around the world. 
ENTP|Happy birthday to one of the greats, Willie Mays! I’ll always remember this conversation we had while on Air Force One during the first year of my presidency. I’ve always looked up to the Say Hey Kid, and I hope he’s having a great 91st birthday. 
ENTP|I couldnt be more grateful for all the love and support I’ve received from my mother-in-law, Marian Robinson, especially during those years in the White House when she was right by our side. We look forward to honoring her with this exhibit.
ENTP|Here’s my statement with Michelle on the draft Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. 
ENTP|Michelle and I extend our warmest wishes to Muslims across our country and around the world as they celebrate Eid al-Fitr. From our family to yours, Eid Mubarak.
ENTP|Our Great National Parks on Netflix showcases the power and beauty of the world’s most breathtaking national parks and wildlife. I hope watching inspires you to experience the outdoors and take action to protect it. Join our Wild For All campaign at 
ENTP|We can learn a lot from what Europe is doing to improve social media. Their approach may not be exactly right for the U.S., but it points toward a path forward. 
ENTP|When I hear about the courage of young leaders in our @ObamaFoundation network, I cant help but feel hopeful. Read Yuliia Sachuk’s powerful story, and learn how she’s helping Ukrainians with disabilities get to safety. 
ENTP|Last week, I spoke with some of the young activists who have already recognized the problem that disinformation poses to our communities and are doing their part to fix it. Take a look at our conversation 
ENTP|I was at @Stanford with the @ObamaFoundation to talk about the rise of disinformation around the world and the threat it poses to democracy. We all have a role to play here, so let’s get to work. 
ENTP|Yesterday, I talked about how we should be able to agree on some basic facts – including around issues like climate change – and how companies need to be more careful about the content they promote, especially in ads. This is a good example of progress. 
ENTP|When it comes to climate change, time really is running out. Earth Day is a reminder that if we pledge to do our part and then follow through on those commitments, we can help preserve and protect our planet for future generations.
ENTP|It’s up to each of us to decide what we value, and to use the tools we’ve been given to advance those values. I believe we should use every tool at our disposal to secure our greatest gift – a government of, by, and for the people – for generations to come.
ENTP|Solving the disinformation problem won’t cure all that ails our democracies or tears at the fabric of our world. But it can help rebuild the trust and solidarity needed to make democracy stronger.
ENTP|Each of us has to pick a side. Do we allow our democracy to wither? Or do we choose to make it better? That’s the choice we face, and it is a choice worth embracing.
ENTP|As part of this, tech platforms need to recognize that they play a unique role in how people consume information, and their decisions have an impact on every aspect of society. With that power comes accountability – and the need for some democratic oversight.
ENTP|The way I’m going to evaluate any proposal touching on social media and the internet is whether it strengthens or weakens the prospects for healthy, inclusive democracy. 
ENTP|Disinformation is a threat to our democracy, and will continue to be unless we work together to address it. Tune in as I share some thoughts on what we can all do now. 
ENTP|I wanted to share some of what Ive read that offers useful context, solutions we can learn from, and interesting perspectives. Check it out, and then tune in to the speech on Thursday at 1215pm PT. 
ENTP|Ive been reading up on this issue, sitting down with academics, researchers, industry leaders and former regulators, and listening to young leaders who are working to make progress.
ENTP|Tomorrow, Im heading to Stanford to deliver a speech about changes in the way we create and consume information, and the very real threat it poses to democracy.
ENTP|Through the @ObamaFoundation, we’re working to empower and equip emerging leaders to tackle issues like the spread of disinformation. 
ENTP|Part of the reason it’s hard to bring about change is because we live in a media environment that elevates falsehoods as much as truths, and divides people as much as it brings them together.
ENTP|In recent years, weve seen how quickly disinformation spreads, especially on social media. This has created real challenges for our democracy.
ENTP|The Asia-Pacific region plays an important role in my own story. Its also home to a generation of young people working to create a better world for us all. Im looking forward to getting to know our newest cohort of @ObamaFoundation leaders.
ENTP|Wishing all who celebrate today a blessed and joyful Easter. After a difficult couple of years, let’s give thanks for all the gifts we enjoy—and the people who make this life special. 
ENTP|Michelle and I send our warmest wishes to all those gathering tonight for Passover Seder. Chag sameach! 
ENTP|Mayor Washington meant a lot to Michelle and me—just like he did to so many folks in Chicago. We continue to look to his work as inspiration for the legacy we want to leave behind.
ENTP|.@PeteSouza and I have traveled the world together, and hes captured some iconic shots over the years. So we decided to reflect on some of our favorite memories at national parks. Take a look, and make sure to check out Our Great National Parks on Netflix. 
ENTP|On the 75th anniversary of Jackie Robinson Day, were reminded of his groundbreaking career and legacy that has paved the way for so many who would follow—including me. 
ENTP|75 years ago, Jackie Robinson competed in his first MLB game—despite facing vicious treatment and threats. Throughout his life, Jackie used his voice to stand up for racial justice and in the process, changed America for the better.
ENTP|There’s nothing I enjoy more than being with young people. And last week, I had a chance to speak with some of the bright students at Hyde Park Academy taking part in our Futures Series with the @ObamaFoundation. Heres a look at some of the advice I shared with them 
ENTP|With the release of Our Great National Parks, I thought Id visit one. I had fun at Great Falls Park with the kids from the @BGCAClubs. I hope youll spend some time outdoors, too. Join the #WildForAll Challenge with @TheWCS at 
ENTP|Along with @TheWCS, we’re working to encourage folks to not only experience nature, but also take action to protect our environment and wildlife for generations to come. Go to to learn more.
ENTP|Our Great National Parks is out today on @Netflix, and I cant wait for you to watch it. This @HGMedia series takes a look at the legacy of preservation and conservation, as well as the ways we can protect our amazing wildlife and natural landscapes. 
ENTP|Disinformation is eroding trust in public institutions and threatening democracies around the world. Were working with our @ObamaFoundation Scholars and leaders to combat these forces, break through barriers, and meet their communities where they are. 
ENTP|This is what happens when you have an administration that’s committed to progress. I’m grateful for their work and all the people who have been involved in continuing to make the Affordable Care Act everything it can be.
ENTP|Last week, the Biden-Harris administration announced theyd fix a glitch in the regulations that will lower premiums for nearly 1 million people who need it and allow 200,000 more uninsured Americans to get access to health coverage. 
ENTP|Gerda Weissmann Klein was an author, a historian, and an inspiration to so many around the world. As a Holocaust survivor, she shared her story to remind us of the power of hope and the extent of our strength. Michelle and I send our love to her family. 
ENTP|The students I met yesterday at Hyde Park Academy in Chicago make me hopeful for the future. They’re passionate about making a difference, and I enjoyed hearing their stories and sharing a little advice with them. 
ENTP|Congratulations to Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson for her appointment to the Supreme Court. This is a great day for America, and a proud moment in our history. 
ENTP|No trip to Chicago is complete without a @ChicagoBulls game – and this time I brought along some of the young people who are part of our @MBKAlliance and @GirlsAlliance. 
ENTP|It was great catching up with our latest class of @UChicago Obama Foundation Scholars. They’ve been working hard to improve their communities, and I’m looking forward to following their journeys. 
ENTP|Always great catching up with @POTUS. Thanks for all you’re doing to help even more Americans get access to quality, affordable health care.
ENTP|It’s good to be back at the White House! Tune in as I join the @POTUS and @VP to celebrate the Affordable Care Act and talk about how theyre taking action to make it better. 
ENTP|Progress often feels slow, and victories are sometimes incomplete. But the ACA shows that if you believe that we can improve people’s lives, and if you’re willing to work through obstacles and continually improve, you can make America better.
ENTP|But the ACA was never perfect, and we always knew we would have to make it better. That’s what @POTUS has done since taking office. Today, he’s going even further – lowering premiums for nearly 1 million people and helping 200,000 more uninsured Americans get access to coverage.
ENTP|The ACA also lowered prescription drug costs for 12 million seniors, and allowed young people to stay on their parents’ plan. And it’s eliminated lifetime limits on benefits that often put people in a jam.
ENTP|Because so many people made sacrifices and some members of Congress took courageous votes, we got the ACA across the finish line. Now, more than 30 million Americans have health coverage, and 135 million Americans with pre-existing conditions can’t be dropped or denied coverage.
ENTP|Passing the ACA was incredibly difficult. People who had coverage were worried about losing it, the media was skeptical, misinformation was flying around, and Republicans showed no interest in working with us. But Joe, Harry Reid, Nancy Pelosi and I were determined.
ENTP|The Affordable Care Act is an example of why you run for office – not just to occupy a seat, but to make a difference in people’s lives. Today I’m joining @POTUS and @VP at the White House to celebrate everything the ACA has achieved, and help make it even better.
ENTP|Congratulations to the @KUHoops team on winning the national championship. This team was fun to watch, and they earned their first title since 2008 (which was a pretty good year).
ENTP|Congratulations to the @GamecockWBB team and coach @DawnStaley for winning the national championship. Coach Staley has built a powerhouse, and it’s great to see all their hard work pay off.
ENTP|I heard Betty Reid Soskin is retiring at 100, and want to congratulate her for more than a decade of service as a National Park Ranger. Betty, I hope you realize just how many people appreciate everything you’ve done—myself included. 
ENTP|Im proud of Titus, Ashton, Thaddeus, Jalen, McKinley and Peter for representing @MBKAlliance at @MarchMadnessMBB. These talented young men from Chicago are job shadowing folks putting the weekend together to learn about the magic behind the madness. 
ENTP|Today @POTUS announced that the U.S. will be welcoming 100,000 refugees fleeing the war in Ukraine. This is the right thing to do. If youre looking for ways to help, join @WelcomeUS and support the refugees who will be arriving here soon 
ENTP|As the first woman to serve as America’s top diplomat, Madeleine Albright was a champion for democratic values. Michelle and I send our thoughts to the Albright family and everyone who knew and served with a truly remarkable woman. 
ENTP|The other day, I called up DonnaMarie, Steve, and Amy to hear how the Affordable Care Act changed their lives and thank them for the work they’re doing with @ProtectOurCare to protect it. I hope youll watch and share your own story 
ENTP|.@POTUS’s American Rescue Plan helped strengthen the Affordable Care Act by lowering costs and encouraging a record 14.5 million people to sign up for coverage in 2022. Well keep working to improve the ACA until every American has access to quality, affordable health coverage.
ENTP|During the pandemic, the Affordable Care Act helped make vaccines and COVID-19 tests available for free, covered emergency hospitalizations, and prevented insurance companies from denying anyone coverage based on a pre-existing condition.
ENTP|12 years ago today, I signed the Affordable Care Act into law. I’ve always believed that health care shouldn’t be a privilege for just a fortunate few, but a right for every American. Today, more than 30 million Americans have health coverage thanks to the Affordable Care Act. 
ENTP|It’s been a great year for college basketball, and now #MarchMadness is officially back. I’m excited for some of the young men in our @MBKAlliance to join the action in New Orleans. Heres a look at my picks 
ENTP|And third, a reminder that in the face of brutal repression, there are ordinary Russians that are showing tremendous courage in standing up to a senseless, destructive war. 
ENTP|Second, a useful primer on why no-fly zones don’t offer a simple answer to stopping the bloodshed. 
ENTP|As we bear witness to the tragedy unfolding in Ukraine, here are three articles worth reading. First, a description of the scale of the Ukrainian refugee crisis, underscoring the need for all of us to support relief efforts. 
ENTP|I just tested positive for COVID. I’ve had a scratchy throat for a couple days, but am feeling fine otherwise. Michelle and I are grateful to be vaccinated and boosted, and she has tested negative. It’s a reminder to get vaccinated if you haven’t already, even as cases go down.
ENTP|The @ObamaFoundation has compiled more stories of people who are going above and beyond to help those in need. I hope you’ll read some of them and find ways to get involved 
ENTP|.@Airbnb is offering free, short-term housing for 100,000 refugees fleeing Ukraine. 
ENTP|.@ChefJoseAndres’ nonprofit organization, @WCKitchen, has set up mobile kitchens along the Ukrainian border and near transit hubs to provide meals for refugees. 
ENTP|Drawing on her own story as a refugee, 2018 Obama Fellow @ZarlashtH started the Refugee Trauma Initiative to care for displaced refugees in Greece. Now, @RefugeeTraumaUK is providing lifesaving support to Ukrainians who need help. 
ENTP|Over the last few weeks, we’ve seen people, organizations, and companies around the world stepping up to support the people of Ukraine. Here are some examples I’ve been tracking
ENTP|The Ukrainian people need our help. If you’re looking for a way to make a difference, here are some organizations doing important work. 
ENTP|Richard Hunt is one of the greatest artists Chicago has ever produced, and I couldn’t be prouder that his Book Bird sculpture will live outside of the newest @ChiPubLib branch at the Obama Presidential Center. I hope it inspires visitors for years to come. 
ENTP|It’s hard to believe its been 10 years since Trayvon Martin was killed. Leading up to this anniversary, I reflected on what his death meant to me as president, as a Black parent, and as a Black man—as well as what it meant for our country. 
ENTP|As a protégé of Justice Breyer, Judge Jackson earned a reputation for pragmatism and consensus building. It’s part of why I nominated her twice – first as a district judge, and then to the U.S. Sentencing Commission, where she earned praise from both Democrats and Republicans.
ENTP|I want to congratulate Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson on her nomination to the Supreme Court. Judge Jackson has already inspired young Black women like my daughters to set their sights higher, and her confirmation will help them believe they can be anything they want to be.
ENTP|Last night, Russia launched a brazen attack on the people of Ukraine, in violation of international law and basic principles of human decency. Here’s my statement on what it means, and what should happen next. 
ENTP|Michelle and I were sad to hear about the passing of Paul Farmer. His life was an example of how one man with vision and heart can change the world for the better. 
ENTP|I want to thank everyone who has joined @AllOnTheLine in its mission to end gerrymandering. Every phone call, every testimony, every action has made a difference in the redistricting process. And while our fight for #FairMaps isn’t over, we’ve made real progress.
ENTP|And in Ohio, @AllOnTheLine held 139 training sessions—equipping thousands of Ohioans from every corner of the state with the information and tools they need to fight for fair maps. And when the pandemic hit, All On The Line took its training online. 
ENTP|In North Carolina, Karla Icaza De Austin, an Army veteran from Fayetteville, urged her state legislators to demand transparency, accountability, and fairness in the redistricting process—and reminded them of their duty to follow the will of the people. 
ENTP|Since then, folks across the country have participated in the redistricting process—many for the first time. It’s a testament to the work @AllOnTheLine has done to help folks understand why fair maps matter, and make an impact in their communities.
ENTP|Three years ago, I helped @EricHolder launch @AllOnTheLine, a people-powered campaign to fight gerrymandering and advocate for fair redistricting. All On The Line is driven by the core belief that voters should choose their representatives—not the other way around.
ENTP|John Lewis knew that change could not wait for some other person or some other time. His life was a lesson in the fierce urgency of now. On his birthday, let’s honor his legacy by taking action and creating the change we hope to see in our own communities.
ENTP|It’s exactly the kind of ambition we need if we’re going to protect our planet and avoid the worst effects of climate change.
ENTP|Now the Biden-Harris Administration’s Build Back Better Agenda includes an even larger investment that would create new jobs, help cut emissions in half by 2030, invest in coastal and soil conservation, and a lot more.
ENTP|.@JoeBiden played a major role in getting that passed—and over our eight years in office, carbon emissions decreased by nine percent, while the U.S. economy grew by more than 10 percent.
ENTP|When I signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act in 2009, it included $90 billion for clean energy projects. At the time, it was the biggest investment in renewable energy in American history. 
ENTP|Azita Raji was a great friend and cherished member of my campaign team and administration who served our country with distinction. She represented the very best of America, and we are better off because of her leadership. She will be deeply missed. 
ENTP|Happy Valentines Day, Michelle! With a smile that lights up the world, youre truly one-of-a-kind. Today and always, I am thankful to have you in my life. 
ENTP|Yes we can. Yes we did. Thanks to all of you who believed, volunteered, voted—and then carried the baton forward in your communities. Keep at it. 
ENTP|If you worked as an organizer on the campaign or volunteered in your community, I’d love to hear your stories from that day using #Obama08.
ENTP|What gave me the confidence to move forward in spite of the odds were the people I met, including those on our campaign. They didn’t do it for me. They did it because they believed in what this country could be, and that we could change it for the better. 
ENTP|It’s hard to believe that 15 years have passed since I stood in front of the Old Capitol in Springfield, Illinois, and announced my candidacy for President. At the time, our campaign was viewed as a longshot—historic perhaps, but unlikely to end in the White House. 
ENTP|Antonio Dickey is a photojournalist who has spent the last 44 years capturing life in Chicago. Take a look at his conversation with the @ObamaFoundation to learn more about his career, the stories behind his photos, and his hopes for the future of Chicago. 
ENTP|As we celebrate Black History Month, it’s important to remember that we shouldn’t treat this month as though it is somehow separate from our collective American history. Black history is American history.
ENTP|For anyone who cares about voting rights, @EricHolder’s new book is essential reading. It tells the story of our long, sometimes frustrating, but ultimately hopeful journey towards a more perfect union—and offers great advice for the road ahead.
ENTP|Jackie Robinson changed baseball, and paved the way for so many others who would follow. As we celebrate his birthday and the start of Black History Month, we honor Jackie’s courage and recognize his incredible legacy. 
ENTP|Today, we still have more work to do to create a more equitable workforce, but Lilly remains an inspiration to me and so many others. 
ENTP|On this day thirteen years ago, I signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. It was the first law I signed as President, and was a first step to closing the wage gap for women. 
ENTP|This record-setting enrollment period was a result of the hard work of @POTUS and Democrats in Congress. By passing the American Rescue Plan, they made health care more affordable for millions, building on a legacy I am deeply proud of. 
ENTP|This week’s redistricting victory in Alabama is a win for our democracy. I’m grateful to @DemRedistrict and everyone who has been fighting so hard to make sure people everywhere have an equal opportunity to choose their representatives. 
ENTP|On Holocaust Remembrance Day, we honor the victims and survivors of one of the darkest periods in our history. But it’s not enough to remember — we also need to have the courage to speak out against acts of bigotry and hatred whenever we see them.
ENTP|The Biden Administration has set up a way for folks to get four at-home COVID tests for free. Go to to order, or call their hotline at 1-800-232-0233. And if you need to get vaccinated or boosted, visit today.
ENTP|The road ahead will not be easy, especially when one of our two major parties is standing in the way. But I still believe we can create a brighter future together, and I look forward to watching the Biden Administration build on this progress. 
ENTP|This Administration has also recommitted to the fight against climate change, and signed a crucial infrastructure law to improve roads and buildings across our country. And theyre only getting started.
ENTP|Under his leadership, our economy set the record for the most jobs added in a single year. Over 200 million people are now vaccinated against COVID-19. The American Rescue Plan provided relief to families. More people can now afford healthcare.
ENTP|For eight years, I witnessed firsthand the empathy and precision @POTUS brought to our work repairing the American economy. And one year into his presidency, President Bidens administration has led a historic recovery effort.
ENTP|In his inaugural address one year ago today, @POTUS committed to press forward with speed and urgency, for we have much to do in this winter of peril and possibility. In the year since, he and the @VP have made significant progress in the face of enormous challenges. 
ENTP|When Michelle and I launched the @ObamaFoundation, we turned to you first. We read your letters and emails, and listened to your ideas. Five years later, we’ve come a long way with your help — and we’re even more excited about what’s next. 
ENTP|Thanks to the life-saving work by scientists and our government’s top medical experts, we have COVID-19 vaccines to protect us. This is what happens when we trust science, and hardworking doctors and researchers set out to do big things. 
ENTP|Congrats to our newest cohort of @ObamaFoundation Europe Leaders! These bright, innovative young people are tackling the most pressing issues in their communities, and I cant wait to see what they can do together.
ENTP|Happy birthday, Michelle. My love, my partner, my best friend 
ENTP|With the King family marching today, we remember that the fight for voting rights takes perseverance. As Dr. King said, There are no broad highways to lead us easily and inevitably to quick solutions. We must keep going. May we honor his memory through action forged in faith. 
ENTP|Weve seen how the Affordable Care Act continues to help folks—especially in states that didnt expand Medicaid—get the peace of mind they need. But we still have more work to do to expand access to quality, affordable health care. 
ENTP|Tomorrow, January 15th is the last day to sign up for health care until the fall at Make sure to get covered today.
ENTP|The House just passed the Freedom to Vote John R. Lewis Act. Now the Senate needs to do the same. Its the best way to protect the right to vote, end partisan gerrymandering, and restore crucial parts of the Voting Rights Act.
ENTP|That’s why I fully support @POTUS’s call to modify Senate rules as necessary to make sure pending voting rights legislation gets called for a vote. And every American who cares about the survival of our most cherished institutions should support the President’s call as well.
ENTP|The filibuster has no basis in the Constitution, and in recent years, it has become a routine way for the Senate minority to block important progress on issues supported by the majority of voters. But we can’t allow it to be used to block efforts to protect our democracy.
ENTP|Now is the time for the U.S. Senate to do the right thing and call a vote on crucial voting rights legislation. Future generations are counting on us to protect our democracy. I wrote out some thoughts about why this is so important. 
ENTP|I wanted to share some of those stories, and also hear about the work you’ve been doing to create change 
ENTP|Five years ago during my Farewell Address, I asked you to believe in your ability to bring about change. Since then, many of you have answered the call – starting nonprofits, organizing around important issues, and running for office yourselves. 
ENTP|It was a great honor to pay tribute to my friend, Harry Reid. Few people have done more for Nevada and our country over the years than this driven, brilliant, sometimes irascible, deeply good man from Searchlight. 
ENTP|Through his groundbreaking roles and singular talent, Sidney Poitier epitomized dignity and grace, revealing the power of movies to bring us closer together. He also opened doors for a generation of actors. Michelle and I send our love to his family and legion of fans. 
ENTP|One year ago, a violent attack on our Capitol made it clear just how fragile the American experiment in democracy really is. Here’s my statement on what the anniversary means, and what we need to do today. 
ENTP|I’m hopeful about 2022. This year will undoubtedly have its challenges, just like 2021 did. But we’ve made it this far—and I still believe we can build a brighter future together. Happy New Year!
ENTP|If youre feeling discouraged about our democracy, read this article about how citizens in Michigan took politics out of the redistricting process. It’s why the work @EricHolder and the @DemRedistrict are doing to fight gerrymandering is so important. 
ENTP|When Harry Reid was nearing the end, his wife Landra asked some of us to share letters that she could read to him. In lieu of a statement, here’s what I wrote to my friend 
ENTP|Congrats to all the scientists and engineers involved with launching this once-in-a-generation telescope! Proud my administration supported it when the going got tough, and I cant wait to see what it uncovers about the fundamental origins of our universe.
ENTP|He never lost his impish sense of humor and willingness to find humanity in his adversaries, and Michelle and I will miss him dearly.
ENTP|Archbishop Desmond Tutu was a mentor, a friend, and a moral compass for me and so many others. A universal spirit, Archbishop Tutu was grounded in the struggle for liberation and justice in his own country, but also concerned with injustice everywhere. 
ENTP|Merry Christmas, everybody! This year, I got a little help spreading holiday cheer from Sunny. Wishing you all a peaceful and joyful holiday season with the ones you love. 
ENTP|I thought I knew Green Eggs and Ham better than most people, but at Kimball Elementary’s vaccination site earlier this month I finally met my match. 
ENTP|Weve seen @MBKAlliance communities across the country step up throughout the pandemic to expand opportunities for boys and young men of color. Heres a look at some of the important work they’ve done this year 
ENTP|Proud of the South Side Wolfpack team for all their hard work and dedication this season!
ENTP|Im inspired by the stories of progress that came from 2021—especially the example set by a new generation of young leaders making a difference in their communities. Take a look at the work that came out of the @ObamaFoundation over the past year.
ENTP|Ive always enjoyed listening to a wide variety of music, so it’s no surprise that I listened to a little bit of everything this year. I hope you find a new artist or song to add to your own playlist. 
ENTP|Next up are my favorite movies of the year. Each of these films tells a powerful story, and I hope you enjoy them as much as I did. 
ENTP|Since these are works I have actually listened to, watched, or read, I’m sure I’ve missed some worthy stuff. So if you have your own recommendations to share, I’ll add them to the stack of books and movies I hope to catch up on over the holidays!
ENTP|Over the next few days, Ill share my annual list of favorite books, music, and movies. Art always sustains and nourishes the soul. But for me, music and storytelling felt especially urgent during this pandemic year. Ill start by sharing some of my favorite books of 2021 
ENTP|You heard, @POTUS – get covered today at 
ENTP|The best way to honor them—the only way that really matters—is to fight this epidemic of gun violence and prevent even more senseless death and suffering. We can, and must, do more.
ENTP|Nine years ago was one of the darkest days of my presidency. Today we remember the children and adults who were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary, and the families who have endured so much grief.
ENTP|Last week, powerful tornadoes devastated communities across the Midwest and South. Michelle and I are thinking of the families who have lost so much. If youd like to help with the recovery, visit 
ENTP|Michelle and I loved being back in Chicago last week. It was a quick trip, but we packed a lot in — and met some fantastic people along the way. Take a look. 
ENTP|As Chancellor, Angela Merkel served with integrity, leading Germany and Europe through many storms. Drawing on her wise pragmatism and her unrelenting moral compass, she made hard decisions and became a role model for many. Thank you for your leadership. 
ENTP|Eighty years ago today, over 2,400 Americans lost their lives in the attack on Pearl Harbor. Today we remember them, and all those who fought to protect our freedom. 
ENTP|Senator Bob Dole was a war hero, a political leader, and a statesman—with a career and demeanor harkening back to a day when members of the Greatest Generation abided by a certain code, putting country over party. Our thoughts are with Elizabeth and the Dole family.
ENTP|Michelle and I wanted to give Santa a hand passing out gifts for the holidays, so we made a stop at the @ComerChildrens Hospital. We hope you and your family have a wonderful holiday season. 
ENTP|I heard the @ChicagoSky and @ChicagoBulls were visiting the South Side YMCA, so I decided to drop by, too. It’s always fun to meet young people who are learning to love the game. 
ENTP|Michelle and I are in Chicago this week to talk to folks who are working on some of the city’s toughest challenges. Yesterday, I met with leaders from across Chicago, heard their stories, and shared ideas. Change is never easy, but we want them to know they’re not alone. 
ENTP|Shots are never fun, but the kids I met at Kimball Elementary knew how important the COVID-19 vaccines are to keep our families and communities safe. Check out @ItsMadeToSave for more information about the vaccines, and make your appointment at 
ENTP|If you got your COVID-19 vaccine before June, now is the time to get a booster shot. All adults are eligible for the booster—just go to to find a vaccine and booster location near you. 
ENTP|Getting our kids fully vaccinated is the best way to protect them against COVID-19. Today, Dr. Fauci and I stopped by Kimball Elementary School to meet with families and kids getting their vaccines—and encourage more parents and kids to do the same. 
ENTP|I’m always inspired by young leaders like Rachid Ennassiri, who is helping more people in Morocco get involved in the fight against climate change. This Giving Tuesday, join the @ObamaFoundation in supporting the work of changemakers like Rachid 
ENTP|From our family to yours, Happy Hanukkah and Chag Sameach! Over the next eight days, may we celebrate the many blessings in our own lives, and be reminded of the enduring power of hope.
ENTP|Earlier this year, I had a chance to speak with Eric Williams, the owner of @TheSilverRoom in Hyde Park. This Small Business Saturday, take some time to support the hardworking small businesses in your city. They appreciate it more than you know. 
ENTP|Happy Thanksgiving! Michelle and I send our warmest wishes to everyone celebrating today. We hope you have a wonderful and safe holiday with the people you love. 
ENTP|Happy birthday to my friend and my brother, @POTUS! Thanks for giving all of us the gift of better infrastructure. Grateful for all you’re doing to build this country back better. 
ENTP|In 2011, my Administration made a pledge to prepare 100,000 new STEM teachers over the next 10 years. I couldnt be prouder to hear that @100Kin10 not only met that goal, but trained an additional 8,000 teachers who will make a difference for our kids. 
ENTP|The epidemic of gun violence in America has gotten worse during the pandemic. This article points to the ways in which the proliferation of guns magnifies the consequences of bias in policing, and makes reform of police practices that much harder. 
ENTP|The newest cohort of @ObamaFoundation Africa Leaders will help unlock the incredible promise of the continent. Im looking forward to supporting their work and following their journeys.
ENTP|Young people like @JackHarries and our @ObamaFoundation leaders are using their platforms to pressure the world on climate change. As we move forward with the Glasgow pact, we must listen and follow through on our commitments to protect our planet and secure a better future. 
ENTP|This Veterans Day, I want to share Tom Voutsoss story. He served in the U.S. Marine Corps, and has continued to live a life dedicated to public service. Through @LadderUpHousing, he’s helping hardworking folks buy their own home. 
ENTP|To every veteran and their family, we thank you for your service and sacrifice to our country. 
ENTP|.@SpeakerPelosi and these members of Congress are making it clear that the United States is back, and will continue to lead the way on climate change. We would not have met our Paris goals without them, and now they’re working to do even more.
ENTP|Young people have more at stake in the fight against climate change than anyone else. I had a chance to talk with some young people who are helping lead the fight, and could not be more impressed by their courage, creativity, and persistence. They give me hope. 
ENTP|If you care about climate change, @JohnDoerrs new book, Speed , Scale An Action Plan for Solving Our Climate Crisis Now, offers concrete steps that we can all take to make a difference. 
ENTP|That’s why, if we’re going to act on the scale that’s required, climate change can’t be seen as another opportunity to score political points. We need everybody. And young people in particular have an opportunity to make a real difference.
ENTP|But once again, progress is partial. Most nations have failed to be as ambitious as they need to be, and the escalation of ambition that we anticipated in Paris six years ago has not been uniformly realized.
ENTP|The good news is that countries around the world recognize this is a decisive decade if we want to avoid a climate disaster, and are setting important goals for 2030. They’ve also promised to help countries move away from fossil fuels and deal with the effects of climate change.
ENTP|I spoke at COP26 in Glasgow about what’s happened in the six years since the Paris Agreement, and how much further we still need to go to control climate change. 
ENTP|We’ve done some important work since the Paris Agreement was signed six year ago, but we’re still nowhere near where we need to be on climate. Watch live from #COP26 in Glasgow as I talk about the steps we can take to combat climate change. 
ENTP|Five years ago, the Paris Agreement went into effect. Paris provided an important framework in the fight against climate change, but it wasn’t enough. That’s why I’ll be speaking in Glasgow on Monday about the road ahead and what young people in particular can do to help. 
ENTP|Visit to find your polling location. And if you have any questions, call the voter hotline at 833-336-8683.
ENTP|Today is Election Day, and so much of what we care about is on the ballot––from access to health care to bringing our economy back from COVID-19 to combating climate change. We need everybody going out to vote. So make a plan to vote, and make your voice heard.
ENTP|In a country as large and diverse as ours, progress can often feel frustrating and slow, with small victories accompanied by frequent setbacks. But once in a while, it’s still possible to take a giant leap forward. That’s what the Build Back Better framework represents. 
ENTP|Climate change isn’t a distant environmental issue—it’s already having an immediate impact on our lives, including huge national security implications as more communities come under stress. 
ENTP|When you look at the history of big social movements, they’re usually started and sustained by young people who put in the work to make it happen. As we look to COP26, I’m inspired by the young people using their voices in the fight against climate change.
ENTP|It was great to be back in New Jersey! Theres too much at stake in this election to sit it out. Lets keep New Jersey moving forward by re-electing @PhilMurphyNJ and Democrats up and down the ballot. Make a plan to vote early—and get everyone you know to do the same.
ENTP|Virginians delivered for me twice, and now I’m asking them to do it again by electing @TerryMcAuliffe as their next governor. Every bit of progress in Virginia is at stake in this election—and theres no time to waste. Make a plan to vote early at 
ENTP|Some of the most important changes often start in state legislatures. Thats why Im proud to support these candidates for the Virginia state legislature. I hope youll join me and the @DLCC in giving them your vote.
ENTP|Glad I had a chance to talk with our new champs! I really am proud of this team and their work this season.
ENTP|At a time when voting rights are being rolled back, the Freedom to Vote Act would strengthen our democracy and give more Americans a voice. That’s why the Senate should do the right thing and protect what so many generations fought so hard to secure.
ENTP|It was great speaking with the @MBKAlliance Advisory Council, and hearing more about the work they’re doing to make a difference in the lives of boys and young men of color across the country.
ENTP|General Colin Powell understood what was best in this country, and tried to bring his own life, career, and public statements in line with that ideal. Michelle and I will always look to him as an example of what America—and Americans—can and should be. 
ENTP|Congrats to our new WNBA champs, @ChicagoSky! I couldn’t be prouder of this team — they worked hard for this moment, and have made our city proud.
ENTP|Today, we lost an icon with the passing of Timuel Black. Over his 102 years, Tim was many things a veteran, historian, author, educator, civil rights leader, and humanitarian. Michelle and I send our thoughts to his family, and everyone who loved him. 
ENTP|I was deeply saddened to learn about the passing of General Ray Odierno after a battle with cancer. He devoted his life to serving this country, and for that I will always be grateful. Michelle and I send our thoughts to his wife Linda, and their children. 
ENTP|Congratulations to Maria Ressa and Dmitry Muratov. This award is a tribute to their extraordinary courage and the enduring value of fact-based journalism and freedom of expression, which is under threat in far too many places today.
ENTP|And of course, I’m excited for my @WhiteSox to be back in the playoffs. It’s going to be hard to top a walk-off home run on the Field of Dreams, but if any team can do it, it’s this one. Go Sox! 
ENTP|It’s always good to be from Chicago, but this year is especially sweet. Congratulations to the @ChicagoSky for making it to the WNBA finals, and to the legend, @CandaceParker, for making all of us proud. We’ll be rooting for you.
ENTP|If we don’t stand up for democracy, we’ll see this type of gerrymandering happen in even more states. It’s why @DemRedistrict is fighting for #FairMaps. And it’s why the Senate must pass the Freedom to Vote Act to protect our communities from partisan gerrymandering.
ENTP|And in Georgia, Republicans released a congressional map that decreases the voting power of communities of color – including African Americans in a historically Black district – and ignores how the state has changed.
ENTP|In Texas, for example, Republicans recently passed a law making voting harder, especially for people of color. Now they’re advancing a new congressional map that’s tilted in their favor and doesn’t reflect the state’s growth.
ENTP|Right now, state legislatures across the country are setting new boundaries for state legislative and congressional districts. And in many states, Republicans are drawing maps that allow them to hold onto power.
ENTP|Our latest production from Higher Ground, Ada Twist, Scientist, is now on Netflix. Based on the book series, the show will continue the work we started at the White House Science Fair. We hope it inspires more young people to discover science and use their imagination to create. 
ENTP|Happy anniversary, Miche! Over the past 29 years, Ive loved watching the world get to know you not just as a daughter of the South Side, but as a mother, lawyer, executive, author, First Lady, and my best friend. I can’t imagine life without you. 
ENTP|Happy 97th birthday, President Carter! Thank you for the extraordinary example of lifelong service that youve set for all of us.
ENTP|Today, we officially broke ground on the Obama Presidential Center on the South Side of Chicago. Michelle and I can’t imagine a better investment in the city we love, and generations of young leaders who will help create change. 
ENTP|Michelle and I couldnt be more excited to officially break ground on the Obama Presidential Center on the South Side of Chicago. Tune in live 
ENTP|Chicago will always be an important place to @MichelleObama and me, which is why were excited to celebrate the virtual groundbreaking for the Obama Presidential Center in Chicago next week. It’s been a long time coming, and we cant wait to see this project come to life.
ENTP|If we want to give our children and grandchildren a brighter future, the wealthiest Americans and large corporations must pay their fair share in taxes. 
ENTP|The repeal of ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’ allowed these two Marines to be true to themselves while serving in our military. Listen to their story 
ENTP|Ten years ago today, we repealed ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.’ Today our military is stronger and our country is safer because patriotic Americans no longer have to live a lie in order to defend the country they love. 
ENTP|Wishing my friend @JustinTrudeau the best in Canada’s upcoming election. Justin has been an effective leader and strong voice for democratic values, and I’m proud of the work we did together.
ENTP|The Freedom to Vote Act just introduced in the Senate would strengthen our democracy by making it easier for people to vote and harder for politicians and special interests to drown out the voices of ordinary Americans. I support it, and every Senator should do the same.
ENTP|Many of the refugees fleeing Afghanistan stood by America and risked everything for a chance at a better life. With the launch of we can support our new Afghan neighbors and reaffirm our common humanity. I hope youll join us.
ENTP|Today we honor the nearly 3,000 men, women, and children who died on September 11, 2001, and the heroes who have always run towards danger to do what’s right. Let’s never forget that day, and let’s never take them for granted. 
ENTP|It was great speaking with @SurgeonGeneral Murthy and the COVID-19 Community Corps volunteers across the country whove been spending their time and energy encouraging their communities to get vaccinated. Their work is making a difference and will help us end this pandemic.
ENTP|California! You’ve got a big choice to make by September 14, and everything is on the line. Your vote could be the difference between protecting our kids or putting them at risk, helping Californians recover or taking us backwards. Vote no on the Republican recall.
ENTP|Great memories of an important day. 31 million people now have health insurance—and the peace of mind that comes with it—thanks to the Affordable Care Act. Now @POTUS is committed to making it even stronger through his Build Back Better plan.
ENTP|The pandemic has devastated communities everywhere. But the young leaders in our newest class of @ObamaFoundation Scholars studying at @UChicago and @Columbia give me hope for a better future. Congratulations, Scholars!
ENTP|Labor Day is about honoring folks like Maurice Harris—a devoted husband and father of five, who has spent his career working in the trades in Chicago. Hell soon help build our Obama Presidential Center. Here’s his incredible story 
ENTP|This Labor Day, let’s honor all the working men and women who make this country what it is—and the American labor movement that has helped protect them, especially during this pandemic.
ENTP|Michelle and I are thinking of everyone affected by Hurricane Ida, and were grateful to the first responders doing heroic work. Here are some ways to support those in need 
ENTP|May God bless the memory of those we lost, and protect those who remain in harm’s way.
ENTP|Our hearts go out to the families who lost a loved one, and to everyone continuing the mission in Kabul. We’re also thinking of the families of the Afghans who died, many of whom stood by America and were willing to risk everything for a chance at a better life.
ENTP|As president, nothing was more painful than grieving with the loved ones of Americans who gave their lives serving our country. As President Biden said, these service members are heroes who have been engaged in a dangerous, selfless mission to save the lives of others.
ENTP|Like so many of you, Michelle and I were heartbroken to hear about the terrorist attack outside the Kabul airport that killed and wounded so many U.S. service members, as well as Afghan men, women, and children.
ENTP|Yesterday, the House passed the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act that will help Americans everywhere make their voices heard. Now the Senate needs to follow the House’s lead. Call your Senators and ask them to do the right thing. Our democracy is on the line.
ENTP|The Olympics may be over, but the @Paralympics are just getting started. Many of the athletes on @TeamUSA have traveled amazing journeys to reach the top of their sport, and I’ll be cheering them on. Hope you will, too.
ENTP|Right now, thousands of people in Haiti are injured and even more are homeless after an earthquake hit the island on Saturday. If you’re looking for ways to make a difference, here are some organizations that are helping Haitians recover and rebuild. 
ENTP|Tomorrow is the last day to sign up for health insurance during this special enrollment period. Go to and join more than two million Americans who have gotten covered over the last six months.
ENTP|We’re at a turning point in the redistricting process, and maps drawn in the next 12 months will determine the next decade of representation in our country. @AllOnTheLine is empowering folks to demand accountability during redistricting—join them 
ENTP|Congress needs to summon the same courage we saw a half century ago when the Voting Rights Act was passed and guarantee every American a voice and a vote.
ENTP|The Voting Rights Act, signed into law 56 years ago today, was a monumental piece of legislation. But with the Supreme Court and state legislatures making it harder to cast a ballot, we can’t take voting rights for granted.
ENTP|From the coal mines of Pennsylvania to the halls of Congress, Rich Trumka was a fierce advocate for working Americans. He loved this country, and he never missed an opportunity to remind us what we can be. Thinking of his family, friends, and federation on this difficult day.
ENTP|One of the things I’ve always loved about basketball is the fact that it brings people together and empowers young people everywhere. I’m proud to join the team at @NBAAfrica and look forward to seeing the change we can create across the continent.
ENTP|COVID-19 has gotten more contagious, so it’s more important than ever to get vaccinated. Vaccines are safe, and the best way to protect yourself and your loved ones. Go to to find one near you.
ENTP|Bob Moses was a hero of mine. His quiet confidence helped shape the civil rights movement, and he inspired generations of young people looking to make a difference. Michelle and I send our prayers to Janet and the rest of the Moses family.
ENTP|I could not be prouder of the incredible athletes representing @TeamUSA at the Olympics. Their determination and hard work got them this far, and they’re ready to seize this moment. Well be rooting for them all the way.
ENTP|Since Bruce @springsteen and I first sat down to record our podcast Renegades Born in the USA, folks have asked about the stories we told and the people and places that shaped us, and we’re excited for this new book to continue the conversation we started last summer. 
ENTP|Even when he was confined to the darkness of a jail cell, Madiba’s light shone brightly. Today, as we reflect on his legacy, I see Mandela’s spirit alive in our @ObamaFoundation leaders. I’m inspired by their service, and the work they’re doing to create the change we need now.
ENTP|As Republican legislatures across the country deliberately try to make it harder to cast a ballot, we need to keep fighting to make sure every citizen has a voice and a vote. The future of our country is at stake.
ENTP|John Lewis and C.T. Vivian loved this country so much that they risked their lives so that it might live up to its promise. They gave all of themselves to the cause of freedom and justice, and inspired generations to follow their example. Now it’s up to us to continue the work. 
ENTP|For more than nine years, DREAMers have watched courts and politicians debate whether they’ll be allowed to stay in the only country many of them have ever known. It’s long past time for Congress to act and give them the protection and certainty they deserve.
ENTP|Starting today, working families are getting monthly payments of up to $300 per child thanks to @POTUS American Rescue Plan. This is an historic step that will help families make ends meet and lift millions of children out of poverty. 
ENTP|With so many folks getting together with family and friends, there’s a lot to celebrate this summer. Here’s a playlist of songs I’ve been listening to lately—its a mix of old and new, household names and emerging artists, and a whole lot in between. 
ENTP|While we were still in the White House, I began sharing my summer favorites—and now, it’s become a little tradition that I look forward to sharing with you all. So heres this years offering. Hope you enjoy them as much as I did. 
ENTP|Three Guinness World Records and now the national spelling bee champ! Congrats, Zaila—your hard work is paying off. We’re all proud of you. 
ENTP|Michelle and I sat down with some terrific young people from @KidsPress to talk about We The People, our latest @Netflix series through Higher Ground. Were hoping these songs teach the next generation about how our government works and what it means to be an active citizen. 
ENTP|If you want to make sure that insiders can’t drown out the voices of ordinary folks, I hope youll check out @AllOnTheLines Redistricting U. Its a training designed to help you engage with the map-drawing process in your state. Sign up today 
ENTP|Its more urgent than ever for Congress to pass robust new voting rights legislation—now.
ENTP|In the wake of the SCOTUS ruling further weakening the Voting Rights Act, take a look at how one Republican in Michigan was subjected to harsh attacks from within his own party for simply acknowledging the validity of the election results in his state. 
ENTP|Happy Fourth of July, and Happy Birthday, Malia! It’s been such a joy to watch you begin to make your own way in the world with poise, grace, and humor. I miss the days when you thought the fireworks were for you. 
ENTP|Libraries are citadels of knowledge and empathy—and they’ve played an extraordinarily important role in my life. I spoke with @SmithsonianSec Bunch about our shared love of books, A Promised Land, and the role storytelling plays in shaping our history. 
ENTP|Our progress on the journey to equality sometimes feels like two steps forward, one step back. But when marriage equality became the law of the land six years ago, justice arrived like a thunderbolt.
ENTP|As a dad of two daughters, this movie really hit home for me. Im glad to see it has resonated with so many people.
ENTP|Congratulations to the @CripCampFilm team on their @PeabodyAwards! I could not be prouder of the disability rights activists who inspired this film, the directors who brought their story to life, and our team at Higher Ground for their hard work.
ENTP|By telling her story, Natoma Canfield helped us pass the Affordable Care Act. She was an inspiration to me and so many others, which is why her letter still hangs in my office. Michelle and I send our condolences to Natoma’s family. 
ENTP|The Senate is preparing to take action on a bill that would strengthen our democracy, but Republican Senators are afraid to even debate it. This week, @EricHolder and I had a chance to talk with folks across the country about what’s at stake – and how we can make a difference. 
ENTP|I’m really proud of young men like James and Lazarus who, despite the obstacles they have faced, are raising their daughters with tremendous love and care. To all the dads out there—Happy Father’s Day.
ENTP|Now that Juneteenth is a federal holiday, take a minute to learn about Opal Lee—the woman who did more than anyone to make it happen. Let’s follow her lead and try to leave our grandkids a better world than the one we came up in. 
ENTP|On Monday, I’m joining @EricHolder for a grassroots conversation with @AllOnTheLine to talk about why redistricting matters and how the Senate can help protect our democracy. Join us 
ENTP|Now we need to build on the Affordable Care Act and continue to strengthen and expand it. That’s what @POTUS Biden has done through the American Rescue Plan, giving more families the peace of mind they deserve.
ENTP|The principle of universal coverage has been established, and 31 million people now have access to care through the law we passed—with millions more who can no longer be denied coverage or charged more because of a preexisting condition.
ENTP|Today, the Supreme Court upheld the Affordable Care Act. Again. This ruling reaffirms what we have long known to be true the Affordable Care Act is here to stay.
ENTP|On the ninth anniversary of DACA, I’m thinking about all the brave DREAMers who have stepped forward to tell their stories. They have fueled a movement that is still working to guarantee the permanent protections they deserve. I will always be inspired by their fight. 
ENTP|Happy birthday, Sasha! You’ve grown so much, and it’s been a joy to watch you become the person we always hoped you’d be. Your mom and I can’t wait to see where life takes you next. 
ENTP|Its always great catching up with @POTUS, and Im grateful for everything he and his administration have done to protect and expand the Affordable Care Act. Lets keep working until every American has access to quality, affordable health care.
ENTP|On National Gun Violence Awareness Day, we #wearorange to honor those we’ve lost. As we begin to emerge from the pandemic, let’s not forget the other epidemic killing far too many Americans—and keep working to pass commonsense gun safety laws that will protect our communities.
ENTP|Coaches like Ernest Radcliffe are changing lives every single day. They understand how sports can help us build relationships, communicate better, and learn how to get back up when life knocks us down. Thanks for letting me stop by practice, Coach! 
ENTP|Yesterday, I sat down with some of the Obama Presidential Center’s neighbors—local business owners who help hold the South Side of Chicago together. We talked about how the @ObamaFoundation can catalyze more inclusive economic development and their hopes for the future. 
ENTP|Michelle and I are excited to share our latest show from Higher Ground We The People. Some of our favorite artists got together with amazing animators to remix civics—and the result is a lot better than what we had in school. Check it out on @Netflix this July 4. 
ENTP|It’s great to be back in my hometown and even better to spend some time with talented young people in Jackson Park. I’m proud of the Wolfpack for a terrific season, and for their leadership off the field as well. Thanks for letting me give a guest pep talk!
ENTP|.@brhodes has been a close advisor and a good friend for more than a decade. His new book, After the Fall, is a personal, timely look at how America has shaped the world we live in—for better and worse—and the importance of continuing to lead by example. Its a great read! 
ENTP|On the 100th anniversary of the Tulsa Race Massacre, we remember all those who were killed and the survivors who bravely continue to share their stories so that we never forget this painful part of our history. Take a moment to learn about what happened 
ENTP|This Memorial Day, let’s remember the men and women who sacrificed everything for the people they served with and the country they loved. We owe them all an enormous debt of gratitude. 
ENTP|.@MarcusRashford is way ahead of where I was at 23—and not just because he’s a better athlete. It was great talking with him about everything from our shared love of reading to how we can lift up the next generation of leaders. 
ENTP|At today’s @MBKAlliance Leadership Forum, we’re talking about the amazing levels of activism we’ve seen since George Floyd was killed—and the need to reimagine policing and public safety. Join us live. 
ENTP|The COVID-19 vaccines are a miracle of modern science, and getting one is the best way to protect yourself and your family. If you haven’t already, schedule an appointment near you at 
ENTP|At a time when so much of the debate around vaccinations and other public health measures has been politicized, this article offers a useful reminder of the role of modern science in fundamentally transforming all of our lives. 
ENTP|When injustice runs deep, progress takes time. But if we can turn words into action and action into meaningful reform, we will, in the words of James Baldwin, cease fleeing from reality and begin to change it.
ENTP|Today, more people in more places are seeing the world more clearly than they did a year ago. It’s a tribute to all those who decided that this time would be different—and that they, in their own ways, would help make it different.
ENTP|On Wednesday, I’ll join activists, community leaders, and young people from the @MBKAlliance for a conversation about transforming tragedy into meaningful reform in the year since George Floyds murder. Find out how you can join us live 
ENTP|I recently spoke with a group of HBCU students who are helping folks in their communities get vaccinated. They’re doing amazing work, and have some great advice about how to answer questions and build trust. 
ENTP|Spending time with young folks always makes me hopeful about the future. I had a great time catching up with @ChiPubSchools South Shore students and talking about some of our plans for the Obama Presidential Center.
ENTP|This month marks 60 years since the Freedom Riders bravely set out on two buses to challenge segregation in the South. To mark this anniversary, the @ObamaFoundation spoke with three of those freedom riders. I hope you’ll listen to their story 
ENTP|On International Nurses Day, let’s celebrate the nurses and medical professionals around the world who do so much for so many. And let’s thank them the best way we can by getting the COVID-19 vaccine and encouraging our friends and family to do the same.
ENTP|When @POTUS signed the American Rescue Plan, it led to the largest expansion of health care since the Affordable Care Act. Now close to 1 million people have signed up for health care since February. Make sure youre covered at 
ENTP|Happy Mother’s Day to @MichelleObama and all the moms celebrating today. I hope you take a moment to thank the women who love you in that special way that mothers do, and remember those who are no longer with us. 
ENTP|He was exactly what we needed and more than we ever expected. We will miss him dearly. 
ENTP|He tolerated all the fuss that came with being in the White House, had a big bark but no bite, loved to jump in the pool in the summer, was unflappable with children, lived for scraps around the dinner table, and had great hair. 
ENTP|Today our family lost a true friend and loyal companion. For more than a decade, Bo was a constant, gentle presence in our lives—happy to see us on our good days, our bad days, and everyday in between. 
ENTP|Happy 90th birthday to Willie Mays! If it wasnt for folks like Willie and Jackie Robinson, I might never have made it to the White House. The spirit he played with and the way he carried himself changed the game and people’s attitudes. I’m glad he’s still going strong. 
ENTP|It was because of them I was able to travel to New York City later that week and tell some of the people who had a loved one murdered by al Qaeda on September 11 America has never forgotten your loss. Watch my full conversation with Bill 
ENTP|This week, Admiral Bill McRaven joined me to reflect on the operation against Osama bin Laden ten years ago. Looking back, I am grateful to Bill, his team, and the thousands of people across government, whose work made it possible for that mission to succeed. 
ENTP|Bernie Wong was a trailblazer who spent her life advocating for Asian Americans and immigrant communities in Chicago and across the U.S. Her legacy of community leadership inspired me and so many others, and her impact will be felt for generations to come. 
ENTP|During President @JoeBiden’s first 100 days, the economy has created more than 1 million jobs, more than 200 million shots have been administered, and we’re on our way to cutting child poverty in half. And as we saw last night, this is just the beginning.
ENTP|States have just learned how many seats they have in Congress for the next decade. This process is an important step in making sure our maps—and electoral process—better reflect our communities. Get involved in the fight for fair maps with @AllOnTheLine
ENTP|The world’s attention must remain on Myanmar, where I’ve been appalled by heartbreaking violence against civilians and inspired by the nationwide movement that represents the voice of the people. 
ENTP|I love wandering into independent bookstores and discovering new voices and new authors. So on Independent Bookstore Day, I wanted to talk with some of the folks who help support authors and nourish our communities. 
ENTP|No challenge poses a greater threat to our planet and to future generations than climate change. I’m proud that the @ObamaFoundation supports young people leading this fight and that the Obama Presidential Center reflects our commitment to sustainability. 
ENTP|Today, a jury did the right thing. But true justice requires much more. Michelle and I send our prayers to the Floyd family, and we stand with all those who are committed to guaranteeing every American the full measure of justice that George and so many others have been denied. 
ENTP|With all the enormous challenges facing the world, it’s worth taking the time to appreciate extraordinary human achievement and our relentless impulse toward discovery. 
ENTP|I want to share a new book, Power to the Public, that illustrates how nonprofits and governments can use technology to solve some of the most pressing issues of our time. It includes some good examples and is worth a read for anyone who cares about making change happen. 
ENTP|Walter Mondale championed progressive causes and changed the role of VP—so leaders like @JoeBiden could be the last ones in the room when decisions were made. In selecting Geraldine Ferraro, he also paved the way for @VP to make history. Michelle and I send prayers to his family.
ENTP|Charles and @Shaq agree we can all help end this pandemic by getting the COVID-19 vaccine. Its the only way to keep everyone safe and help us get back to all the things we miss most—from seeing family and friends to watching sports in person. 
ENTP|After nearly two decades in Afghanistan, it’s time to recognize that we have accomplished all that we can militarily, and bring our remaining troops home. I support @POTUS’s bold leadership in building our nation at home and restoring our standing around the world. 
ENTP|Michelle and I are thrilled to be one step closer to bringing the Obama Presidential Center to the South Side of Chicago. We hope it will help lift up the South Side and breathe new life into Jackson Park and the surrounding communities. 
ENTP|You can find resources and ways to help here 
ENTP|Our hearts are heavy over yet another shooting of a Black man, Daunte Wright, at the hands of police. It’s important to conduct a full and transparent investigation, but this is also a reminder of just how badly we need to reimagine policing and public safety in this country. 
ENTP|Through his extraordinary example, His Royal Highness Prince Philip proved that true partnership has room for both ambition and selflessness — all in service of something greater. Our thoughts are with Her Majesty the Queen, the Royal Family, and the British people. 
ENTP|The only way we’ll be able to beat this pandemic is if enough people get vaccinated. So join me, Michelle, and Americans everywhere in getting the COVID-19 vaccine as soon as it’s available to you—and encourage your friends and family to do the same. 
ENTP|Read about other developments from communities working together to reimagine policing in our recent @MBKAlliance report. 
ENTP|More places are experimenting with programs that send civilian responders instead of police to help people experiencing mental health crises. It’s a promising development in law enforcement in the wake of this summer’s protests. 
ENTP|This Easter, I hope we can all take some time to reflect on the blessings we enjoy and the hope we have for a brighter future. From our family to yours, have a safe and happy Easter. 
ENTP|Congratulations to @MLB for taking a stand on behalf of voting rights for all citizens. There’s no better way for America’s pastime to honor the great Hank Aaron, who always led by example.
ENTP|It’s always great catching up with @IsabelWilkerson, and this time we’re talking about A Promised Land and our mutual love of books with @BNBuzz. Take a look 
ENTP|Bruce and I agree that our most important anchor over the years has been our families. We’re both lucky enough to have remarkable partners who ground us, and kids who help us understand what really matters in life. Listen to our conversation on @Spotify 
ENTP|My family and I are mourning the loss of our beloved grandmother, Sarah Ogwel Onyango Obama, affectionately known to many as Mama Sarah but known to us as Dani or Granny. We will miss her dearly, but we’ll celebrate with gratitude her long and remarkable life. 
ENTP|As we build the Obama Presidential Center on the South Side of Chicago, were focused on generating sustainable jobs for the local community. Our new workforce initiative will open doors to those often left out of the construction industry. 
ENTP|Let’s be clear This is a deliberate attempt to undermine our democracy by making it harder to vote. That’s why passing the For the People Act is so important, and why every one of us needs to keep up the fight. Our future depends on it.
ENTP|Now we need to keep it up. Because until every single American has access to quality, affordable health care, we have more work to do—and I’m grateful to President Biden for continuing to lead the fight.
ENTP|The American Rescue Plan lowers premiums for millions of families, makes health insurance more affordable for low-and middle-income Americans, and provides incentives for states to expand Medicaid and cover as many as four million additional Americans.
ENTP|And now, thanks to the hard work of President Biden, Senator Schumer, Speaker Pelosi, and Americans all across the country who have spent years fighting against repeal and pushing to improve the law, our starter home is starting to look pretty spacious.
ENTP|The Affordable Care Act has helped 20 million Americans get coverage—and up to 130 million Americans can no longer be denied coverage because of a preexisting condition. It has been a lifeline for Americans whove lost their jobs and their health insurance during the pandemic.
ENTP|As part of the American Rescue Plan, @POTUS just signed the largest expansion of health care since the Affordable Care Act. It’s an example of how government is supposed to work, and exactly what I hoped would happen when I signed the ACA into law 11 years ago today. 
ENTP|A once-in-a-century pandemic cannot be the only thing that slows mass shootings in this country. It’s time for leaders everywhere to listen to the American people when they say enough is enough. 
ENTP|Join me, @ProtectOurCare, and health care advocates from across the country to discuss 11 years of the Affordable Care Act and the work we still need to do to make sure all Americans have access to quality, affordable health care. Watch now 
ENTP|Bruce @Springsteen and I both had complicated relationships with our fathers. In our latest conversation on Renegades Born in the USA, we discuss our upbringing, masculinity, and the role our fathers played in helping us become the men we are today. 
ENTP|11 years after the Affordable Care Act was passed, it’s getting even better. I’ll be having a conversation with @ProtectOurCare this Monday, March 22 at 115 PM ET and hope you’ll join 
ENTP|.@POTUS set a goal to deliver 100 million vaccine shots in 100 days. His administration hit the milestone in just 58. Let’s keep it going Please get the vaccine as soon as it’s available to you. It’s the only way to beat this pandemic. 
ENTP|Like many of you, I’m thrilled that #MarchMadness is finally back. You can check out my picks here 
ENTP|Michelle and I pray for the victims, their families, everyone grieving these needless and devastating killings—and we urge meaningful action that will save lives.
ENTP|Yesterdays shootings are another tragic reminder that we have far more work to do to put in place commonsense gun safety laws and root out the pervasive patterns of hatred and violence in our society.
ENTP|Congrats to directors @NicoleNewnham, @JimLeBrecht, and everyone with @CripCampFilm on the Oscar nomination! The heart, passion, and brilliance of those who led the disability rights movement is something to celebrate. Michelle and I hope youll watch their story on Netflix.
ENTP|I could not be prouder of the @ChiPubSchools students I spoke with recently about A Promised Land. One of the reasons I wrote this book was for young people to be able to see themselves in my story—and I hope our conversation left them as inspired as it left me. 
ENTP|For the latest episode of our podcast, I talk to Bruce @Springsteen about my time as a community organizer and the influences that led to me pursuing a career in public service. Take a listen on Spotify 
ENTP|When @POTUS was elected, he said help was on the way—and he delivered. The American Rescue Plan is landmark legislation that will ring through generations, lifting up families and beating back this pandemic. Heres how it will help people like you 
ENTP|Michelle and I got vaccinated against COVID-19 because we know it’s the best way to beat this pandemic, protect one another, and get the country back up and running again. So I hope you’ll get the vaccine as soon as it’s available to you. It could save your life. 
ENTP|From my first cross-country road trip as a child to Bruce’s experience coming of age toward the end of the Vietnam War, @Springsteen and I each continue to reflect on moments from our upbringing that helped shape our view of America. Listen here 
ENTP|Fifty-six years after Bloody Sunday, our march is not yet over. There are more steps to be taken, more bridges to be crossed. And that’s why the Obama Presidential Center is designed to honor the giants who carried us and inspire the next generation to lead us forward. 
ENTP|This is the kind of progress that’s possible when we elect leaders across government who are devoted to making people’s lives better—and a reminder of why it’s so important to vote.
ENTP|This landmark legislation will help families pay rent and put food on the table, lift millions of children out of poverty, make health care more affordable, aid small businesses, fund broad-based vaccination efforts, and make it easier for states to reopen schools.
ENTP|Elections matter—and we’re seeing why. Congratulations to the Biden Administration and to the American people on a COVID relief bill that will improve the lives of families across the country.
ENTP|.@BillGates new book is an exceptionally clear and accessible primer on climate change. Hes unblinking in the difficulty of meeting this challenge but maintains a cautious optimism that it can be met—and provides a framework for action that is both specific and workable. 
ENTP|And as we rightly celebrate what Democrats accomplished in the 2020 election, it’s always worth analyzing those successes in depth—and looking at where we came up short—as we look toward future cycles. This interview includes some ideas worth considering 
ENTP|The Biden administration’s commitment to democratic values at home and abroad couldn’t be more important—because democracy remains at risk around the world 
ENTP|If you haven’t read Michelle’s memoir yet, I hope you do—especially if the young readers’ edition might resonate with you or someone you know. Becoming isn’t just a title—it’s a process we all go through, and Miche’s story brings that to life with real honesty and beauty.
ENTP|Music has always been an important part of my life, and I think it’s safe to say that the same is true for @Springsteen. In this episode, we talked about the songs that’ve made a difference for us—and Bruce even brought out the guitar. Listen on @Spotify 
ENTP|To date, My Brother’s Keeper has touched thousands of lives, and these are just a few stories of the inspiring young men we’ve met. By joining the @MBKAlliance, you can help us reach even more. 
ENTP|Today marks seven years since we launched My Brother’s Keeper to reduce barriers and expand opportunity for boys and young men of color. And it remains true that the only way our country lives up to its ideals is if our young people can reach their fullest potential. 
ENTP|I first picked up Toni Morrison’s novels when I was entering college, and her voice fundamentally changed my perspective on the world. This Black History Month, I reflected on the impact that her writing has had on my life. 
ENTP|It was great to hear from this impressive group of young leaders. If theres one thing we can bank on, it’s that young folks like these are our best hope for a more sustainable and just world.
ENTP|In each of us, theres a story to be shared—a story that’s sacred and can bring us together. I had such a good time talking with the @WellReadBlkGirl Book Club about A Promised Land because just as they learned about my story, I had a chance to learn from theirs. 
ENTP|Even as we focus on fighting COVID-19, it’s important to recognize that there’s another pandemic raging right now—one that’s decades in the making and unique to the United States. We need to treat gun violence with the same urgency and resolve. 
ENTP|Sending my prayers to @TigerWoods and his family tonight—here’s to a speedy recovery for the GOAT of golf. If we’ve learned anything over the years, it’s to never count Tiger out.
ENTP|Last year, I sat down with my good friend Bruce @Springsteen for a long and meaningful conversation that touched on so much of what we’re all dealing with these days. I’m excited to share it with you over the next few weeks 
ENTP|For decades, John Lewis not only gave all of himself to the cause of freedom and justice, but inspired generations that followed to try to live up to his example. On his birthday, we honor his memory, and work toward continuing his legacy by creating change in our communities.
ENTP|I want to share this inspiring book about the events leading up to the 1960 election, from Dr. Kings imprisonment to student activism in Atlanta to JFKs campaign. Its a story we can all learn from—a story of overlooked heroes and the power each of us has to create change. 
ENTP|Congrats to @NASAJPL on landing @MarsPersevere today! Looking forward to seeing what this mission uncovers—and proud our administration invested in this effort eight years ago to help continue America’s rich tradition of exploration and discovery.
ENTP|I felt inspired and hopeful after speaking with students in @TheTellingRoom’s Young Writers , Leaders program. I wrote #APromisedLand in part because I hoped to reach young people like those in this group—the unique voices of a new generation, energized and unafraid to dream big.
ENTP|Michelle and I are thinking of everyone across the country braving the winter storms this week. Here’s an overview of how you can help—or, if you’re in Texas, where you can go to stay warm or get support. 
ENTP|Great news Thanks to President Biden, starting today, you can go to to sign up for health insurance. If you’re uninsured or hoping to change plans, here’s a good article that can help you figure out if you’re eligible. 
ENTP|Happy Valentine’s Day to the three who never fail to make me smile. Your dazzling light makes everything brighter. 
ENTP|During our time in the White House, Michelle and I were proud to display artwork from artists like Alma Thomas and Charles Alston—whose work provoked thought, challenged our assumptions, and shaped how we define our narrative as a country. 
ENTP|There is a lot of disinformation out there, but here’s the truth You should get a COVID vaccine as soon as its available to you. It could save your life—or a loved one’s. 
ENTP|Climate change is a real threat to us all—but feeling helpless or overwhelmed isn’t going to solve it. As long as we stay hopeful and keep working with the urgency the challenge demands, we can make a difference. 
ENTP|I’m proud to announce that the Obama Presidential Center will officially break ground in 2021. Our hope is that the center will breathe new life into historic Jackson Park while delivering jobs, growth, and much more to the South Side. Let’s get to work. 
ENTP|Black-owned independent bookstores play a critical role in communities all across our country. I wanted to show my support, so I dropped in to surprise the folks from @MahoganyBooks , the Very Smart Brothas Book Club. Take a look. 
ENTP|When Jackie Robinson faced down slurs, spiked cleats, and pitches aimed at his head—and stole home anyway—he didnt only change baseball. He changed the world and paved the way for others, including me. On his birthday, we’re called not only to honor that legacy but build on it. 
ENTP|In her extraordinary career, Cicely Tyson was one of the rare award-winning actors whose work on the screen was surpassed only by what she was able to accomplish off of it. She had a heart unlike any other—and for 96 years, she left a mark on the world that few will ever match. 
ENTP|.@EkpeUdoh—I saw your tweet about A Promised Land and thought I’d respond. For me, the title of my book is about the work we need to do to realize the promise of becoming a more perfect union, even if we don’t get there in our lifetimes. Glad to see your book club is reading it! 
ENTP|Here’s an example of the incredible risks and burdens that our essential workers have been facing. And even as we move toward vaccinating our population, we all need to remain vigilant until we’ve beaten this pandemic. 
ENTP|Hank Aaron was one of the best baseball players we’ve ever seen and one of the strongest people I’ve ever met. Michelle and I send our thoughts and prayers to the Aaron family and everyone who was inspired by this unassuming man and his towering example. 
ENTP|This is a time for boldness and President Biden is already delivering. By rejoining the Paris climate accords on day one, he declared loudly and clearly that the U.S. will once again lead the fight against climate change. And this is only the beginning. 
ENTP|On a day for the history books, @TheAmandaGorman delivered a poem that more than met the moment. Young people like her are proof that there is always light, if only were brave enough to see it, if only were brave enough to be it. 
ENTP|Congratulations to my friend, President @JoeBiden! This is your time. 
ENTP|On #MLKDay, we celebrate his life but we’re also called to live out his values through service of our own. Here are some ways you can get involved in your community 
ENTP|If anyone had a right to question whether our democracy was worth redeeming, it was Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Because in the face of billy clubs and lynchings, poll taxes and literacy tests, he never gave in to violence, never waved a traitorous flag or gave up on our country. 
ENTP|Happy birthday to my love, my partner, and my best friend. Every moment with you is a blessing. Love you, Miche. 
ENTP|And here’s a look back at the response to last summer’s Black Lives Matter protests. 
ENTP|And here’s one that is more anecdotal. 
ENTP|For those who are wondering why so much attention has been focused on the response of the Capitol Police to the Trump-inspired riots, here’s a data-driven article that provides some useful frame of reference. 
ENTP|Here’s my statement on today’s violence at the Capitol. 
ENTP|My friend John Lewis is surely smiling down on his beloved Georgia this morning, as people across the state carried forward the baton that he and so many others passed down to them. 
ENTP|Georgia voters—If youre in line before the polls close at 7 pm, stay there. You have the right to vote, no matter how long it takes. If you have questions, call the Georgia voter protection hotline at 1-888-730-5816. Lets bring this home.
ENTP|Great to see you out there, Tyriek. First-time voters are making a difference today!
ENTP|Thanks for voting, Emily—and thanks even more for committing to stay involved after today. Your state and your country need you!
ENTP|If you have questions or run into any issues at your polling location, call the Georgia voter protection hotline at 1-888-730-5816. 
ENTP|Georgia, this is it. Today is Election Day and your vote can help elect @ReverendWarnock and Jon @Ossoff to the U.S. Senate. Make your voice heard today and vote—either in person or by dropping off your mail-in ballot at a ballot drop box. 
ENTP|If you’re a Georgia voter, you can respond tomorrow with the most powerful tool we have as Americans—your vote. Make a plan to vote in person or drop off your mail-in-ballot at a ballot drop box. Check-in with your family and friends to do the same. 
ENTP|Georgia, you voted in record numbers to send @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris to the White House. Now we need you to show up again to vote @ReverendWarnock and Jon @Ossoff to the U.S. Senate. Make your plan to vote on Tuesday, January 5 at 
ENTP|And here’s a story that reminds us of the power of fresh starts, community, and the good that’s in all of us, across the country and around the world. 
ENTP|After a year that has tested us in unimaginable ways, weve seen how people from all walks of life have stepped up to create change to make things better. Heres to ringing in 2021 with optimism for whats to come and a belief that our best days are still ahead. Happy New Year!
ENTP|We’re just one week away from the U.S. Senate runoff elections in Georgia. If you’re in Georgia, make a plan to vote early if you can and reach out to your friends and family to make sure they do the same. 
ENTP|The redistricting process in 2021 will be a snapshot of democracy in action, and @allontheline is working to ensure everyone has a voice. We’ve accomplished a lot together this year, but theres still so much work to do. Join us 
ENTP|This Christmas looks different for all of us. As we spend time with those we love—in person or virtually—let us celebrate the blessings we cherish, embrace the spirit of giving, and look out for one another. From my family to yours, Merry Christmas! 
ENTP|It’s unconscionable that there are families worried over the holidays that they’ll be evicted next month. Extending the eviction moratorium was a start, but Congress has to do more to help folks who can’t pay rent because of COVID-related unemployment. 
ENTP|With COVID cases surging worse than ever, getting vaccinated is one of the most important things we can do. But until the vaccine is widely available, socially distancing and wearing masks will actually save even more lives, and alleviate the pressure on healthcare workers.
ENTP|Here are some of my favorite songs of the year. As usual, I had some valuable consultation from our family music guru, Sasha, to put this together. I hope you find a new song or two to listen to. 
ENTP|Like everyone else, we were stuck inside a lot this year, and with streaming further blurring the lines between theatrical movies and television features, I’ve expanded the list to include visual storytelling that I’ve enjoyed this year, regardless of format. 
ENTP|From Willie Mays to Mamie Johnson, the players and teams in the Negro Leagues changed the game of baseball and paved the way for so many today. Glad to see the @MLB officially recognize them as major leaguers. 
ENTP|As 2020 comes to a close, I wanted to share my annual lists of favorites. I’ll start by sharing my favorite books this year, deliberately omitting what I think is a pretty good book – A Promised Land – by a certain 44th president. I hope you enjoy reading these as much as I did. 
ENTP|I had some fun answering questions about #APromisedLand for BookTube. I talked to creators about everything from fatherhood, to celebrating science at the White House, to the role strong women played in my life. You can watch the full episode on @YouTube 
ENTP|There’s just one day left to sign up for heath care during open enrollment. If you or someone you know needs coverage, head to right now to sign up for an affordable plan that works for you and your family.
ENTP|Georgians, today is the first day of early voting – make a plan to vote right now and vote early if you can. Then, make sure your friends and family in Georgia do the same. 
ENTP|Georgia’s runoff election will determine whether the American people have a Senate that’s actually fighting for them. You can get involved right now—make calls, chip in, and do whatever you can to help elect @ReverendWarnock and @Ossoff 
ENTP|Here’s a great way to call voters in Georgia and help them get ready to vote. A couple hours this weekend could help Democrats win the Senate.
ENTP|Happy Hanukkah to all those celebrating around the world. This year has tested us all, but its also clarified what really matters. May the lights of the menorah remind us to cherish the blessings we have and offer glimmers of hope. From my family to yours, Chag Sameach!
ENTP|In A Promised Land, I talk about the decisions I had to make during the first few years of my presidency. Here are some thoughts on how I approach tough questions 
ENTP|With COVID-19 cases reaching an all-time high this week, weve got to continue to do our part to protect one another. This pandemic is far from over and your actions can help save lives. 
ENTP|To all of you in Georgia, today is the last day to register to vote in the upcoming runoff election. Take a few minutes right now to register to vote, and then make sure everybody you know is registered, too. 
ENTP|Thanks for sharing Marjon. I hope you get something out of A Promised Land – keep up the good work!
ENTP|Glad to see A Promised Land in such good company.
ENTP|If youre in Georgia, make sure you and everybody you know is registered to vote by Monday, December 7. And if you turn 18 by January 5, youre eligible to vote in the runoff. Get registered right now 
ENTP|Join me for a conversation with the next U.S. Senators from Georgia, @ReverendWarnock and @Ossoff, along with @StaceyAbrams and @NikemaWilliams. The stakes couldn’t be higher for their runoffs 
ENTP|We started the @ObamaFoundation to help a new generation build a better tomorrow. And many of them already are, stepping up through the pandemic and protests to demand real change. On Giving Tuesday, Im asking you to invest in them 
ENTP|Let’s all do our part this Thanksgiving to keep people safe and healthy. Celebrate virtually, if you can. Wear a mask. And as always, listen to the experts. The choices you make could save lives.
ENTP|The balance of power in the Senate is at stake in Georgia’s runoff election. We’ve got two great candidates—@ReverendWarnock and @Ossoff—who need your support. Go to to find ways to get involved.
ENTP|Michelle and I are eager to bring the Obama Presidential Center to our hometown—a way to honor the city we love, all those who came before us, and pay tribute to people coming together to do extraordinary things. 
ENTP|This was fun. I heard Tim and Fred were listening to some of the songs on my A Promised Land playlist, so I decided to drop in and surprise them. We talked about a lot, from Bob Dylan to old-school mixtapes to the role music played in my memoir. 
ENTP|My memoir, A Promised Land, is out today. I hope you’ll read it. My goal was to give you some insight into the events and people that shaped me during the early years of my presidency. Most of all, I hope it inspires you to see yourself playing a role in shaping a better world. 
ENTP|Music has always played an important role in my life—and that was especially true during my presidency. In honor of my book hitting shelves tomorrow, I put together this playlist featuring some memorable songs from my administration. Hope you enjoy it. 
ENTP|More than anyone else, I wrote my book for young people—as an invitation to once again remake the world, and to bring about, through hard work, determination, and a big dose of imagination, an America that finally aligns with all that is best in us. 
ENTP|Today, we’re reminded of our solemn obligation to serve our veterans as well as they have served us. To all of our veterans and service members, we’re forever grateful for your commitment to our country—and your willingness to put it all on the line for us. Thank you.
ENTP|Congratulations to my friends, @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris — our next President and Vice President of the United States. 
ENTP|Thank you Chiney, Nneka, and all of the athletes who are using their platforms and helping people vote in this election.
ENTP|Rahul, youre helping make democracy work today. Thank you.

ENTP|Our administration literally left this White House a playbook that would have shown them how to respond before COVID-19 reached our shores. Joe and I revisited it recently. Take a look — and then vote for a leader who will get this virus under control. 
ENTP|On Tuesday, you can choose change. You can choose a better America. You can elect @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris. I am fired up to be back in Florida – let’s bring this home.

ENTP|In Miami this weekend, I dropped by The Shop to talk with @KingJames and @MavCarter about the NBA bubble, the racial justice movement, and whats at stake over these next seven days. Do not give up your power. Make a plan to vote 
ENTP|Republicans love to say right before an election that they’ll protect preexisting conditions. Well, Joe and I actually did it — and he’ll keep protecting your health care as president. We’ve got eight days left. Vote. 
ENTP|In the middle of a pandemic, this administration is trying to dismantle the Affordable Care Act in the Supreme Court. Here’s how Joe and I fought to expand health care, protect millions of Americans with preexisting conditions, and actually get it done

ENTP|Eight months into the pandemic, as new cases are breaking records, we need an administration that’s not going to wave the white flag. A year ago today, @JoeBiden was talking about the leadership we need to get prepared for a pandemic, and he’s got a plan to get it under control.
ENTP|In 2020, we show up early — for everything, but especially for voting. Get out there and vote! 
ENTP|Hello, Florida! Its #VoteEarlyDay and we’re just 10 days away from this election. I want to see you make a plan today for how you’re going to get involved and vote. Let’s get to work.

ENTP|13 days until the most important election of our lifetimes. And you don’t have to wait until November 3rd to cast your ballot. Make a plan, vote, and then help your friends and family make a plan at Let’s do this. 
ENTP|102 never looked better! Grateful for all the folks like your great aunt who continue to show up and vote in this important election.
ENTP|Participate and vote. It’s not always pretty – trust me, I know. But it’s how, bit by bit, we’ve made progress over generations. Go to to make your plan, then get some friends to join you. Let’s go.
ENTP|One of the most inspiring things about this year has been seeing so many young people organizing, marching, and fighting for change. And to change the game on any of the issues we care about, weve got to vote for @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris. 
ENTP|From police reform to funding our schools, the officials with the most power to change the issues we care about in our communities are often found at the state and local levels. So educate yourselves up and down the ticket, make a plan to vote, and vote 
ENTP|.@PeteSouza was always there to document every moment of my presidency, from high-stakes meetings with world leaders to quiet mornings reading briefing memos. The @WayISeeItFilm is one to watch—and a reminder to get registered and make a plan to vote. 
ENTP|Democrats winning control of the Senate will make all the difference on how much progress we can achieve on health care, supporting working families, and more. Join @CatherineForNV and me for todays grassroots event 
ENTP|Nobody should have to wait 11 hours to vote, but we’re all grateful that you—and all those in line with you—stuck it out. Keep making your voices heard, everybody. Our democracy depends on it.
ENTP|There’s still so much work to do to make our communities safe and supportive for everybody. Elected officials can join us by taking the @MBKAlliance’s Reimagining Policing Pledge 
ENTP|In Evanston, IL, Northwestern University faculty and students worked with their police department to develop recommendations to change the city’s use of force policy and improve training and accountability standards. 
ENTP|In Washtenaw County, MI, the new Task Force on 21st Century Policing will include community members, faith and nonprofit leaders, and mental health professionals. Plus, residents will be a part of the selection process for new officers. 
ENTP|In Madison, WI, community groups will now choose the members of a new civilian police oversight board, which must include at least one member who was previously incarcerated. 
ENTP|In June, I called on elected officials across the country to work with their communities to take steps to review and reform their use of force policies. Already, we’re seeing progress
ENTP|Weve only got 20 days to go until Election Day – and weve got to vote for @JoeBiden and Democrats up and down the ballot. I talked to @PodSaveAmerica about this election, the 2020 Census, and the role we can all play to create change in the months ahead. 
ENTP|.@JohnBrennan is one of the hardest-working, most patriotic public servants I’ve ever seen, and our country is better off for it. As president, he was one of my closest advisors and a great friend. And in his memoir, Undaunted, you’ll see why. I hope you’ll read it. 
ENTP|This article is worth a read to learn more about why you should respond and what makes the 2020 Census different 
ENTP|Complete the Census before its too late—it determines the resources your community will get over the next decade, from funding for roads and Medicare to political representation. Take a few minutes before the deadline tomorrow Call 844-330-2020 or visit

ENTP|And congratulations to my friend Alex Smith, for fighting back from a life-threatening injury to start at quarterback again for the Washington Football Team. It’s a testament to his strength, determination and the love and support of his family.
ENTP|Proud of my friend @KingJames for his fourth title, fourth Finals MVP, and for not only living up to the hype after seventeen seasons, but surpassing it as an extraordinary leader both on the court and in the public arena fighting for education, social justice, and our democracy. 
ENTP|Congrats to the @Lakers and @Seattlestorm on their championship wins! Proud of all the NBA and WNBA teams and players whove been using their platforms to take a stand for racial justice and encourage civic participation this season.
ENTP|Join me for a conversation with @EricHolder and @allontheline. We’ll be talking about what’s at stake in this year’s election, the redistricting process, and ways to get involved in the fight to strengthen our democracy. 
ENTP|A couple years ago, I met some promising young men working to prevent gun violence with @ChicagoCred. Talking with them reminded me that one of the best ways to make our communities safer is simple Listen to—and invest in—voices like theirs.
ENTP|And make sure you watch his full speech—one of the best Ive seen Joe give 
ENTP|We have the opportunity to elect a leader who will unify this nation. And that leader is @JoeBiden. We dont have a moment to waste. 
ENTP|It’s going to take a lot of big-thinking and innovation to save the one planet we’ve got—and that’s why @KensingtonRoyal’s leadership on climate change can make a real difference.
ENTP|Theres so much at stake in this election––and millions of Americans have already started voting. If you havent already, make a plan to join them right now. Visit to get all the information you need to vote safely and securely in your state. Lets go.
ENTP|Last night, @KamalaHarris shared how she will work with @JoeBiden to protect the Affordable Care Act and build on it so every American has access to quality, affordable care.
ENTP|#ImVotingFor the future of our democracy—for the young folks who will inherit whatever we leave them. They’ll take the baton from us and do their part to keep carrying progress forward. But it’s our time right now. And the best way to do that is to vote early for @JoeBiden.
ENTP|.@JoeBiden has a plan to build our country back better and create millions of jobs—jobs that can help working families get ahead. Joe helped manage the Recovery Act, which jumpstarted the longest stretch of job growth in our history. And he’ll do it again. 
ENTP|This is as powerful an argument as I’ve heard about the stakes of this election. Watch it. Share it. And get everyone you know to vote for @JoeBiden. 
ENTP|States across the country have voter registration deadlines coming up––and many of them are today. Do your part to protect this democracy and change our country for the better. Register or check your registration, and make a plan to vote 
ENTP|Don’t wait—complete the Census today. From funding for education, health care, and infrastructure in your community to the way you’re represented in government, getting counted matters. Take a minute to call 844-330-2020 or visit 
ENTP|Obviously, we’re in the midst of a big political battle right now, and while there’s a lot at stake, let’s remember that we’re all Americans. We’re all human beings. And we want everyone to be healthy, no matter our party.
ENTP|Michelle and I hope that the President, First Lady, and all those affected by the coronavirus around the country are getting the care they need and are on the path to a speedy recovery.
ENTP|Last night, I surprised a group of first-time poll workers at the @NBA Finals. These @MoreThanAVote volunteers are stepping up to make sure this election runs safely and fairly in their communities –– and you can too by signing up to volunteer at 
ENTP|Im looking forward to catching up with @KamalaHarris and folks around the country at our grassroots fundraiser tomorrow to talk about whats at stake in this election. You still have time to join us! I hope to see you there 
ENTP|Always look forward to watching the NBA Finals––and tonight I had the chance to thank a great group of first-time poll workers with @morethanavote. It’s critical that everybody votes in this election––by mail or in person if you can. Register to vote at 
ENTP|Joe knows this isn’t about him—it’s about us. Make your plan to vote right now. We’ve got to vote like our democracy depends on it. Because it does. 
ENTP|I’m proud to endorse these outstanding Democratic candidates who will work to get the virus under control, rebuild the economy and the middle class, and protect Americans’ health care and preexisting conditions protections. Support these candidates––and vote early if you can. 
ENTP|You dont need me to tell you whats at stake in this election. Now is the time to show up and vote like never before to elect Democratic candidates up and down the ballot. Educate yourself on the candidates running and vote 
ENTP|All right, lets try something new. If you’re in the United States, send me a text at 773-365-9687 — I want to hear how youre doing, whats on your mind, and how youre planning on voting this year. Ill be in touch from time to time to share whats on my mind, too. 
ENTP|Your vote has never mattered more than it does right now. Today is National Voter Registration Day. Go to to register and make a plan to vote. And make sure everybody you know does, too. 
ENTP|Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg fought to the end, through her cancer, with unwavering faith in our democracy and its ideals. That’s how we remember her. But she also left instructions for how she wanted her legacy to be honored. My statement 
ENTP|If youre looking for a way to get involved in this upcoming election, sign up to volunteer as a poll worker for early voting and Election Day. You can help your community and make sure this election runs fairly and safely. Sign up 
ENTP|There’s no feeling like finishing a book, and I’m proud of this one. In A Promised Land, I try to provide an honest accounting of my presidency, the forces we grapple with as a nation, and how we can heal our divisions and make democracy work for everybody. 
ENTP|Over the last few months, Ive learned a thing or two from the young people in our country. I figured I would return the favor by sharing with you how to make a plan to vote in this upcoming election. Get registered and vote early Video @attn 
ENTP|Today we remember the lives we lost on 9/11. Even the smallest act of service is a way to honor them. And just like Jay Winuk, we can honor their memories through service. 
ENTP|The fires across the West Coast are just the latest examples of the very real ways our changing climate is changing our communities. Protecting our planet is on the ballot. Vote like your life depends on it—because it does. 
ENTP|Great to catch up with our next Vice President, @KamalaHarris. I wanted to make sure to share a few tips about serving alongside our friend @JoeBiden. 
ENTP|This Labor Day, let’s thank all those whove kept our country going this year—nurses, teachers, delivery drivers, food service workers, and many more. We can honor them by building our system back even better—so that essential workers are treated like it, pandemic or not.
ENTP|It might be Labor Day weekend, but let’s all remember that were still in the middle of a pandemic. Wear a mask, practice social distancing, and follow the experts. It’ll save lives.
ENTP|The election’s only two months from today. Americans all across the country are making their plans for how and when they’re voting this year, and I hope you are too. Get registered and make sure your friends, family, and neighbors do the same at 
ENTP|Right now, far too many marginalized communities and people of color arent being counted. The impact of this could be felt for decades in our communities. Make sure you and your neighbors get counted 
ENTP|Completing the Census is crucial because it will shape our communities for the next decade. Everything from critical funds and resources for health care, infrastructure, and education to political representation. Complete it now online, by phone, or mail 
ENTP|Joe and Kamala have what it takes to lead this country out of these dark times and build it back better. Join me in helping them get elected 
ENTP|.@JoeBiden is a man who learned to treat every person he meets with respect and dignity, living by the words his parents taught him No one’s better than you, Joe, but you’re better than nobody. That empathy, that decency, the belief that everybody counts—that’s who Joe is. 
ENTP|If you can volunteer as a poll worker for early voting and Election Day, I hope you’ll do it. You can help make sure this election runs fairly and safely—and that’s one of the most crucial things any of us can do for our country right now. Sign up here 
ENTP|Chadwick came to the White House to work with kids when he was playing Jackie Robinson. You could tell right away that he was blessed. To be young, gifted, and Black, to use that power to give them heroes to look up to, to do it all while in pain – what a use of his years.
ENTP|If you’re looking to take action—or looking to educate yourselves on these issues—we’ve gathered some resources from the @ObamaFoundation that can help at 
ENTP|As people exercise their right to protest all across the country––let the undeniable paths of our progress be a guide going forward peaceful, sustained protest, strategic, committed organizing, and purposeful, overwhelming participation at the ballot box.
ENTP|I commend the players on the @Bucks for standing up for what they believe in, coaches like @DocRivers, and the @NBA and @WNBA for setting an example. It’s going to take all our institutions to stand up for our values. 
ENTP|Don’t let them convince you that your vote doesn’t matter. Make a plan to vote and register at Vote early if you can. Tell everyone you know to do the same.
ENTP|Theres a reason some people are working to make it harder to vote, especially for people of color. It’s because when we show up, things change. 
ENTP|Ella Baker, a giant of the civil rights movement, embodies the idea of ordinary people’s ability to create change. She fought for the right to vote and led a movement of young people towards the fight for freedom. You should know her name 
ENTP|While other countries around the world have successfully managed this pandemic, weve seen things get worse. Its not too late for us to work towards recovery, but its going to require leaders with coherent plans to move us forward. 
ENTP|Tonight our next President @JoeBiden made the case for his vision for this country and his plan to get there. Ill be doing everything I can over these next 75 days to make sure we get it done. Join us 
ENTP|Do make a plan right now for how you’re going to vote and vote early, by mail or in person 
ENTP|.@JoeBiden made me a better president. I’m asking you to believe in his and Kamala’s ability to help make us a better country. More importantly, I’m asking you to believe in your own and to help them, in this election and beyond. 
ENTP|Congrats, Joe. I’m proud of you.
ENTP|The 19th amendment is the legacy of all those who marched and organized for transformational legislative change. Progress isn’t about just politics or protest––it’s about both. 100 years later, we’re all so much better off because of their commitment. 
ENTP|This is the Joe I know. 
ENTP|As Michelle said, we’ve got to do everything we can to elect @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris. So make sure you have a plan to vote. Vote early. And tell everybody you know to register to vote at 
ENTP|If youre in a state where you have the option to vote early, do that now. The more votes in early, the less likely youre going to see a last minute crunch, both at polling places and in states where mail-in ballots are permitted. Then tell everyone you know.
ENTP|I talked to @davidplouffe about these attempts to undermine the election, what’s at stake right now, and why we have to do everything we can to elect @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris. 
ENTP|Everyone depends on the USPS. Seniors for their Social Security, veterans for their prescriptions, small businesses trying to keep their doors open. They cant be collateral damage for an administration more concerned with suppressing the vote than suppressing a virus.
ENTP|I’ve known Senator @KamalaHarris for a long time. She is more than prepared for the job. She’s spent her career defending our Constitution and fighting for folks who need a fair shake. This is a good day for our country. Now let’s go win this thing. 
ENTP|I will never forget the commitment to reconciliation and peace that I encountered in Hiroshima in 2016. The memory of August 6, 1945, must never fade, it allows us to fight complacency. It fuels our moral imagination. It allows us to change. 
ENTP|We have to treat voting as the most important action we can take on behalf of democracy. So make sure you are registered to vote. Request a mail-in ballot early and send it back early. Then get your family and friends to do it, too. Every vote counts. 
ENTP|Let’s guarantee that every citizen has equal representation in our government. And end partisan gerrymandering, so that all voters have the power to choose their politicians. And if all this takes eliminating the filibuster—a Jim Crow relic––then that’s what we should do.
ENTP|We can do this by making sure every American is automatically registered to vote, including formerly incarcerated people. Let’s also make sure to add more polling places, expand early voting, and make Election Day a national holiday.
ENTP|Weve got to fight harder to protect the right to vote. It’s one of the most powerful tools we have––and we can start by passing the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. Once we pass that, we should continue marching forward to make it even better.
ENTP|Today is the 55th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act––one of the crowning achievements of our democracy. But once the Supreme Court weakened it, some state legislatures unleashed a flood of laws designed specifically to make voting harder, especially in communities of color.
ENTP|I’m proud to endorse this diverse and hopeful collection of thoughtful, empathetic, and highly qualified Democrats. If you’re in one of their districts or states, make sure you vote for them this fall. And if you can, vote early—by mail or in person. 
ENTP|Welcome home, @AstroBehnken and @AstroDoug! We launched the Commercial Crew program to strengthen our U.S. space program and its been great to see its success. This historic NASA-SpaceX mission is a symbol of what American ingenuity and inventiveness can achieve. 
ENTP|This pandemic is far from over––and our medical professionals continue to put their lives on the line to keep our country going. @JoeBiden and I had a chance to thank Dr. @CraigASpencer for his work during the Ebola crisis and this current pandemic. 
ENTP|John believed that in all of us, there exists the capacity for great courage and a longing to do what’s right. We are so lucky to have had him show us the way. I offered some thoughts today on his life and how, like him, we can give it all we have. 
ENTP|Michelle and I have spent a lot of time together these past few months. We’ve had a lot of good talks—and this one’s up there with the best. Take a listen to the very first episode of Michelle’s podcast 
ENTP|Its National Vote By Mail Day. Voting by mail is easy and safe. Take a few minutes to request your vote-by-mail ballot, then get your family and friends to do the same. Request your ballot early, send it back early, and fill it out carefully. Get started 
ENTP|Were 100 days away from Election Day and there is too much at stake to sit this one out. Nows a good time to make sure youre registered to vote––and to make sure your friends and family are, too. 
ENTP|To celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act, I got the chance to talk to the next generation of activists and advocates in the disability rights movement––theyre continuing the work of the activists in @CripCampFilm and I couldnt be prouder of them. 
ENTP|Although we’ve seen some positive findings recently about the possibilities of developing a vaccine for COVID-19, this article gives a good summary of why it may take months before any effective vaccine can be widely distributed. 
ENTP|I sat down with @JoeBiden to talk about the most pressing issues of our time. Hes exactly the leader we need right now––with the vision, the plans, and character to move America forward. Lets get to work 
ENTP|Doesn’t get much better than sitting down to talk with my friend Joe.
ENTP|Ten years ago, I signed Wall Street reform into law. It was the most sweeping set of financial regulations since the Great Depression—and it’s still working today to prevent another one. Now, it’s up to us to protect it and keep fighting for an economy that works for everybody. 
ENTP|Not many of us get to live to see our own legacy play out in such a meaningful, remarkable way. John Lewis did 
ENTP|Some thoughts on the Reverend C.T. Vivian, a pioneer who pulled America closer to our founding ideals and a friend who I will miss greatly. 
ENTP|Here’s a quick look at how our response stacks up with countries around the world 
ENTP|The latest data offers a tragic reminder that the virus doesn’t care about spin or ideology––and that the best thing we can do for our economy is to deal with our public health crisis. 
ENTP|Get registered and find out how you can vote by mail at 
ENTP|Voting by mail shouldnt be a partisan issue––especially during a pandemic. Everybody should be able to request an absentee ballot, and make their voice heard in every election. 
ENTP|It’s clear our communities are crying out for change—and what that change looks like is up to us. That’s why it’s important to take a hard look at all the perspectives and proposals out there, even the ones we disagree with. It’s how we’ll come up with solutions that last.
ENTP|Finally, here’s a look at how Germany reshaped police training after the horrors of World War II and how this approach might be useful to other countries today. 
ENTP|And here’s a counterbalance that argues for substantial reforms to policing and oversight but not fewer police. 
ENTP|Here’s a piece that outlines the need for a more aggressive overhaul of policing. 
ENTP|As communities around the country try to reimagine how law enforcement can operate in a just, effective and non-discriminatory way, these articles provide some useful background and differing viewpoints on the issue. 
ENTP|For too long, gerrymandering has contributed to stalled progress and warped our representative government. Redistricting begins next year—let’s all do our part to protect and restore our democracy. Join me and @allontheline in the fight for fair maps 
ENTP|Our founding promise has never been guaranteed. Each generation has been called to bring us a little closer to our highest ideals—and history’s calling on us right now. So let’s all do whatever we can to help @JoeBiden expand that promise to all Americans.
ENTP|This holiday weekend, let’s be safe and smart. It’s going to take all of us to beat this virus. So wear a mask. Wash your hands. And listen to the experts, not the folks trying to divide us. Thats the only way we’ll do this—together. 
ENTP|Today I’m tipping my hat to all the giants in the Negro Leagues, from Satchel Paige to Toni Stone and so many others. Their brave example, first set 100 years ago, changed America’s pastime for the better––opening it up for new generations of players and fans alike. 
ENTP|Jim’s courage and persistence helped change America for the better. And so did every American who marched, organized, stood up, came out—or changed their own heart because they love someone who did. Happy anniversary, everybody.
ENTP|Michelle and I want every kid in Chicago to grow up knowing even better opportunities than we had. We’re happy to help Chicago Connected reach every kid in the city. This is where I found a purpose and a family––and it’ll always be our home.
ENTP|I’m joining my friend @JoeBiden tomorrow to talk about everything that’s at stake in this election. I hope you’ll join us, too. This is a critical moment in our history––and all of us have to do our part to build this country into what we know it can be. 
ENTP|Juneteenth has never been a celebration of victory, or an acceptance of the way things are. Its a celebration of progress. Its an affirmation that despite the most painful parts of our history, change is possible––and there is still so much work to do. 
ENTP|and now to stand up for those ideals, we have to move forward and elect @JoeBiden and a Democratic Congress that does its job, protects DREAMers, and finally creates a system that’s truly worthy of this nation of immigrants once and for all.
ENTP|Eight years ago this week, we protected young people who were raised as part of our American family from deportation. Today, Im happy for them, their families, and all of us. We may look different and come from everywhere, but what makes us American are our shared ideals…
ENTP|And here are two more essays that powerfully express the hope, heart, grief, and rage that are driving this moment of potential change. Racism Is Terrible. Blackness Is Not The Trayvon Generation 
ENTP|These Nashville teenagers are representative of the remarkable leadership we’re seeing from young people across the country and around the world. 
ENTP|Today reminds us that progress might be slow. It might take decades. But no matter what things might look like today, it’s always possible. Happy Pride month, everybody. 
ENTP|This young generation makes me optimistic about our future. By protesting, they’re speaking up and shining a light on injustice––and one way we can support them is to vote for people who’ll change the laws on every level. 
ENTP|In Columbia, Maryland, young people wielded social media to connect across boundaries, amplify voices, and enact some real change. 
ENTP|This group of Nashville teens led a peaceful march with tens of thousands of people in their community. 
ENTP|Over the past few weeks, we’ve seen young people in every corner of the country step up and become leaders. Through organization and mobilization, they’re showing us how we can sustain this momentum to bring about real change. 
ENTP|It’s too early to tell if it’s permanent, but the changes brought on by COVID-19 are forcing many of us to reflect on what really matters in our lives. 
ENTP|As has always been true at key moments in history, it’s going to depend on young people to go out there and rewrite what is possible. I couldn’t be prouder of all the young people leading that change right now. Here’s my advice for the Class of 2020 
ENTP|We’ve seen the power that our voices have when we speak out about injustice––but we also know the toll that it takes on our mental health. Today, I talked to @repjohnlewis, Bryan Stevenson, and @MBKAlliance activists about ways to keep our mental health a priority at this time.
ENTP|Third, every city in this country should be a @MBKAlliance community. We have 250 cities, counties, and tribal nations working to reduce barriers and expand opportunity for boys and young men of color. Join us 
ENTP|Second, every mayor should review their use of force policies with members of their community and commit to report on planned reforms. We need mayors, county executives, and those in positions of power to make this a priority. Take the pledge 
ENTP|First, there are specific evidence-based reforms that would build trust, save lives, and lead to a decrease in crime, too. You can find clear, actionable recommendations right here 
ENTP|Real change requires protest to highlight a problem, and politics to implement practical solutions and laws. As I mentioned yesterday in our @MBKAlliance town hall, there are several steps our mayors and elected officials can take right now
ENTP|In our @MBKAlliance town hall yesterday, I mentioned James Baldwins The Fire Next Time. From 1962, it remains a seminal meditation on race by one of our greatest writers and relevant for understanding the pain and anger behind the protests. Excerpt 
ENTP|And third, an extraordinary essay by the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the U.S. Armed Forces, Mike Mullen, explaining the values at risk when we start using our military to control domestic protests. 
ENTP|Here’s a useful read––a reminder of the importance of de-escalation by police in their interactions with protestors. 
ENTP|Let’s do this another way. Lets stop thinking our voice don’t matter and vote. Not just for the presidenteducate yourself and know who you’re voting for. And that’s how were going to hit em.
ENTP|Let’s get to work. 
ENTP|I know the past few months have been hard and dispiriting. But watching the heightened activism of young people makes me hopeful. And if we can keep channeling our justifiable anger into peaceful, sustained, and effective action, this can be the moment when real change starts.
ENTP|If you want to take concrete action, but you’re not sure how, we’ve created a site to connect you with useful resources and organizations who’ve been fighting the good fight at the local and national levels for years. 
ENTP|5. The more specific we can make demands for criminal justice and police reform, the harder it will be for elected officials to just offer lip service to the cause and then fall back into business as usual once protests have gone away.
ENTP|4. So if we want to bring about real change, the choice isn’t between protest and politics––we have to do both. We have to mobilize to raise awareness, and we have to organize and cast our ballots to make sure that we elect candidates who will act on reform.
ENTP|3. To do that, we have to know which levels of government have the biggest impact. Changing the federal government is important. But the elected officials who matter most in reforming police departments and the criminal justice system work at the state and local levels.
ENTP|2. The point of protest is to raise public awareness, to put a spotlight on injustice, and to make the powers that be uncomfortable. But eventually, we have to translate those aspirations into specific laws and institutional practices.
ENTP|1. The protests represent a genuine and legitimate frustration over a decades-long failure to reform police practices and the broader criminal justice system. We should condemn the few who resort to violence––not the overwhelming majority who deserve our respect and support.
ENTP|Ultimately, it’s going to be up to a new generation of activists to shape strategies that best fit the times. But I want to highlight some basic lessons from past efforts that are worth remembering
ENTP|As millions of people across the country take to the streets and raise their voices in response to the killing of George Floyd and the ongoing problem of unequal justice, I’ve heard many ask how we can sustain momentum to bring about real change.
ENTP|I wrote out some thoughts on how to make this moment a real turning point to bring about real change––and pulled together some resources to help young activists sustain the momentum by channeling their energy into concrete action. 
ENTP|My statement on the death of George Floyd 
ENTP|If you believe in a more just, more generous, more democratic America, now is the time to fight for it. Here’s a terrific way to register voters, organize communities, and ramp up turnout in the battleground states that will decide this election 
ENTP|On Memorial Day, we honor those who gave all for us. That takes different forms this year, but it’s even more vital with the loss of so many veterans to COVID-19. The way they lived, in service to one another, should be our roadmap in the months ahead. 
ENTP|And here’s more on the approach Sweden has taken, which differs from some of its neighbors 
ENTP|South Korea has focused on testing to guard against outbreaks 
ENTP|As all 50 states begin the process of reopening, here are three articles that offer some lessons from other countries about the tradeoffs and policies involved. First, here’s what European nations have done to support workers 
ENTP|The Class of 2020 is full of the leaders we need to bend the arc of history toward a better future—and our HBCU grads have the talent, skills, and vision to lead that change. I couldnt be prouder of all of you.
ENTP|As Chicago navigates the health crisis, its residents continue to show up for one another in their communities. It’s one of the things I love most about the city—and one of the many reasons it’s such a good home for the @ObamaFoundation.
ENTP|Congrats to the high school Class of 2020, as well as to the teachers, coaches, and most of all, parents and family who’ve guided you along the way. Thanks for letting me be part of your big day! 
ENTP|Congratulations to the HBCU Class of 2020! Michelle and I are so proud of you. As you set out to change the world, we’ll be the wind at your back. Can’t wait to see what you achieve.
ENTP|Vote.
ENTP|Despite all the time that’s been lost, we can still make real progress against the virus, protect people from the economic fallout, and more safely approach something closer to normal if we start making better policy decisions now. 
ENTP|Change comes when all of us step up and play our part in this democracy. By encouraging our young people, like these students from @ChiPubSchools, to start engaging in our civic life today, we’re already creating something better for tomorrow.
ENTP|There’s no limit to the devotion I’ve seen in teachers like these @ChiPubSchools educators. Their dedication shapes the best parts of who we become. I couldn’t be more thankful for their work, especially as they shift lessons online to keep students on track during this crisis. 
ENTP|I’ve always loved joining commencements––the culmination of years of hard work and sacrifice. Even if we can’t get together in person this year, Michelle and I are excited to celebrate the nationwide Class of 2020 and recognize this milestone with you and your loved ones. 
ENTP|The pandemic has magnified the financial insecurity of too many American families, the deep and real racial disparities in our society – and the imbalanced burdens on working moms. We have to create something better for America on the other side of this. 
ENTP|In moments of crisis, we look out for one other. And we need leaders with empathy who will bring people together rather than drive them apart. @JoeBiden has the character and experience to guide us through one of our darkest times and heal us through a long recovery.
ENTP|This pandemic has painfully brought to the surface many of the reasons I launched @MBKAlliance—structural racism robs too many of our kids of their futures. The leaders on todays call arent just tackling this crisis, they’re helping us build a more equitable future for all.
ENTP|If we want life to approach anything like normal anytime soon, we need a comprehensive testing program. It’s not going to be cheap, but it will ultimately pay off many times over in saved lives, saved businesses, and saved jobs. 
ENTP|While we continue to wait for a coherent national plan to navigate this pandemic, states like Massachusetts are beginning to adopt their own public health plans to combat this virus––before its too late. 
ENTP|Weve all had to adapt to cope with a pandemic. Climate change will force far harsher changes on our kids. All of us should follow the young people whove led the efforts to protect our planet for generations, and demand more of our leaders at every level. 
ENTP|Parents, you deserve a break – Michelle’s got storytime handled every Monday. She’s one of the best, I promise. (And I confess it makes me a little nostalgic.)
ENTP|When I think of people I’ve counted on over the years, Sarah Hurwitz comes to mind. Shes the talented author of @HereAllAlong, and a longtime member of my team. Here she shares her experience with faith, traditions, and staying connected during this time. 
ENTP|Democracy depends on an informed citizenry and social cohesion. Here’s a look at how misinformation can spread through social media, and why it can hurt our ability to respond to crises. 
ENTP|For all of us who love this country and are willing to do our part to make sure it lives up to its highest ideals – now’s the time to fight for what we believe in. Join us at And I’ll see you on the campaign trail as soon as I can.
ENTP|I’m proud to endorse my friend @JoeBiden for President of the United States. Lets go 
ENTP|Dreamers have contributed so much to our country, and they are risking their lives fighting on the frontlines of this pandemic. They deserve permanent immigration status and a pathway to citizenship—as they are Americans in every way but on paper. 
ENTP|We cant deny that racial and socioeconomic factors are playing a role in who is being hit the hardest by the virus. Its a reminder for our policymakers to keep our most vulnerable communities at the forefront when making decisions. 
ENTP|Although our celebrations may look different this year, our unwavering faith remains the same. For me, Easter is a time of hope––a reminder of rebirth and renewal––and a belief in a better day to come. From my family to yours, we wish you all a blessed and joyful Easter. 
ENTP|Let’s not use the tragedy of a pandemic to compromise our democracy. Check the facts of vote by mail. 
ENTP|Everyone should have the right to vote safely, and we have the power to make that happen. This shouldnt be a partisan issue. 
ENTP|Thank you to @VirginiaAllen5 for having me on her podcast to discuss my latest book, March to the Majority. 
ENTP|The prospect of a former president being indicted in four different jurisdictions – New York City, Atlanta, Miami, and the District of Columbia – by Democrat prosecutors is a spectacle of enormous danger to the future of the American Republic. 
ENTP|If the Justice Department is now claiming there is an ongoing investigation of Hunter Biden the question is what are they investigating? Is it the potential bribery charges? Is it the gap between payments received and income admitted? Is it about laundering money?
ENTP|The Justice Department deal with Hunter Biden now eliminates any excuse for not commenting on the investigation. You should today pursue all the information they have refused to give you because there is no longer a PENDING investigation and they now have no excuse to keep their investigations and activities secret.
ENTP|For my latest podcast, I give feedback on President Trump’s arraignment in federal court in Miami on Tuesday. 
ENTP|My latest book, March to the Majority, is officially a national bestseller. Get your copy today. 
ENTP|Baseball once stood for American greatness, but when the MLB openly invites attacks on Christian faith and undermines the family-friendly environment that baseball has long stood for, its days as Americas pastime are fading fast. @MikePence @BrianBurchCV 
ENTP|March to the Majority is essential reading. Thank you @CraigSmpa for the wonderful review of my latest book. 
ENTP|Ill be on Varney , Co. this morning on Fox Business Network at 900 am ET. Follow at @Varneyco
ENTP|The critical lesson from March to the Majority is a positive Republican party that emphasizes what is for over what it is against can grow an establishment that drives out and replace a big-government-socialist-woke coalition that is ruining America. 
ENTP|There is a parallel between what is happening to President Trump and the American people’s rejection of woke brainwashing. Please read my latest. 
ENTP|Any proposal to significantly cut Medicare benefits is suicidal and virtually guarantees a Democratic House after the 2024 election. There is NO popular majority favoring some ideologically driven suicide pact on Medicare. We reformed Medicare successfully in 1996 because we worked with the American people and improved it but did not threaten anyone.
ENTP|In writing March to the Majority, I hope to inspire you to dream big, work hard, learn every day, and enjoy the American promise that our Creator endows you with the right to pursue happiness! 
ENTP|Everyone should understand the debt ceiling deal is only the first step in fixing the US economy. Watch my latest commentary on Straight Arrow News. @StraightArrow

ENTP|It was fun speaking with Brandie Smith, director of the Smithsonian’s National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute, for my latest podcast. 
ENTP|My new book March to the Majority is not only about the Republican Revolution of 1994, but also about the challenges our nation faces today and offers principals for governing the American people. 
ENTP|74 years ago today george Orwell published 1984 warning that democracies could become tyrannies forcing citizens to ignore truth and repeat state imposed lies. Biden team, FBI, DOJ, major universities fit Orwell’s warning.

ENTP|Target’s recent decision to debut a line of LGBTQ clothing for children launched the song Boycott Target to the No. 1 spot on iTunes. 
ENTP|The teachers union used the pandemic to advance a destructive agenda that will hurt the advancement of education for our nations children. Great article. 
ENTP|Vice President Kamala Harris is taking point on defending us from the dangers of AI. This should comfort no one. @StraightArrow 
ENTP|Americas New Majority Project is posting several important polls about our military. I encourage everyone to read and subscribe. 
ENTP|Shifting resources away from a combined arms Marine Corps to a technologically advanced but combat weak force is the wrong move. Congress should demand in depth hearings on this incredibly stupid strategy. 
ENTP|As we’ve learned from the Durham Report, the corrupt media is protecting the corrupt establishment. Where are the Woodwards and Bernsteins when we need them most? 
ENTP|From the New York Posts editorial board Kevin McCarthy’s debt-limit deal is a win for Republicans and the nation. 
ENTP|The agreement reached Saturday night between Speaker Kevin McCarthy and President Joe Biden is an historic first step toward shifting government back toward common sense and conservatism. 
ENTP|.@callygingrich and I wish Secretary Kissinger a happy 100th birthday and many more to come. He is a true statesman who has made the world safer.
ENTP|The Debt limit deal is a dramatic victory for Speaker McCarthy and House Republicans. Before they passed their history changing bill no one would have believed it possible to cut spending, reestablish work requirements, reform permitting for energy and infrastructure and more
ENTP|Ill be on Hannity tonight at 900 pm ET. Watch on @FoxNews @seanhannitynews
ENTP|Rep. Jason Smith, Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, joins my podcast to discuss the latest debt ceiling discussions. 
ENTP|Any default on the debt is President Bidens fault, he has spent nearly 100 days avoiding meeting with Speaker McCarthy. 
ENTP|It is clear from the Durham Report and House Republican hearings that the current scandals in the Biden White House are much deeper and more cancerous than Watergate ever was.

ENTP|The University of Austin, TX, is taking a new innovative approach to improving the American education model. Interesting reading. @AcademicRenewal 
ENTP|We are a lot closer to the Biden default with the President’s game playing and arrogance. House Republicans will NEVER support a Biden tax increase. Biden’s comments in Japan were dishonest and destructive. If we default it will be Biden who forced it.
ENTP|Speaker McCarthy and House Republicans have a tremendous opportunity to create a better American future. @amspectator 
ENTP|We are drifting toward a Biden default ad he and his staff refuse to negotiate in a serious manner. Congressional Republicans have a bill that avoids default. It is Biden who is risking default
ENTP|Ill be on The Ingraham Angle tonight at 1000 pm ET. Watch on @FoxNews @IngrahamAngle
ENTP|For my latest podcast, I talk with Rep. Jay Obernolte about whether Congress should pass legislation regulating Artificial Intelligence. @JayObernolte 
ENTP|I thought of these two stories while watching Speaker Kevin McCarthys discussion with the White House Press Corps after meeting with President Joe Biden. Speaker McCarthy has advocated for serious negotiations for the last 97 days while President Biden has avoided them. 
ENTP|It is time for Congress to hold hearings with members of the disability community and leaders in the business and technology industry to identify the challenges and hurdles faced by users with disabilities and developers of online and digital platforms. @HonTonyCoelho

ENTP|Scott Rasmussen reports By a margin of more than 2-1 (58% to 27%),voters prefer Speaker McCarthy’s plan to raise the debt ceiling and cut the growth of federal spending to 1% a year for ten years over President Biden’s plan to raise the debt ceiling with no spending cuts.
ENTP|For several decades, the U.S. Navy has been the guarantor of commerce and safe passage in international waters. Under the weakness of the Biden administration, our navy does nothing when Iran engages in open piracy. 
ENTP|Following Tuesdays meeting, President Biden continues to stonewall. Meanwhile, Speaker McCarthy is in an excellent position to remain calm and cheerful. Read my latest opinion piece 
ENTP|What President Biden and Congressional Democrats fail to realize is that the debt ceiling debate this year is fundamentally about fiscal discipline. @dhwinston @myramiller @TheWinstonGroup 
ENTP|In the latest Rasmussen Reports survey, voters said they think Hunter Bidens problems are a big deal and that President Biden likely traded influence when he was vice president for money. @SecretsBedard

ENTP|Thanks to Speaker McCarthy’s strategic leadership in the House and Senator McConnell’s support, Congressional Republicans are entering negotiations with President Biden in a remarkably strong position. 
ENTP|Speaking with @MariaBartiromo this morning at 800 AM on @FoxBusiness Channel. Tune in! @MorningsMaria

ENTP|PBS and NPR are so biased toward the left that they should no longer receive public funding. If they want to be neutral, they should start by restoring the FRONT ROW with Mark Rotterman show in North Carolina. @FrontRowmarc 
ENTP|Sen. Joe Manchin is showing outstanding leadership in the Senate by calling on President Biden to come to the table and negotiate with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy on a compromise to raise the debt ceiling. 
ENTP|House Republicans have done their job. Any threat of default now rests on President Biden’s shoulders. 
ENTP|Senate Republicans are backing Speaker Kevin McCarthy’s debt ceiling bill and calling on their Democratic colleagues to do the same. 
ENTP|Members of Congress are seeking answers on how China set up police stations in U.S. cities.

ENTP|The state of Michigan is getting into secret deals with the Chinese Communist Party and all of America should be concerned. @petehoekstra @GatestoneInst 
ENTP|Because of the weakness of the Biden administration, our allies are turning toward China for support. This is very concerning. @CliffordDMay 
ENTP|For my latest podcast, I talk with Erin Walsh from The Heritage Foundation about the influence the Chinese Communist Party has in the United States. @Heritage 
ENTP|As Speaker McCarthy puts forward a sensible plan for lowering the nations debt, Democrats have no interest in listening or solving the problem. Excellent piece for everyone to read from David Ditch. @davidaditch 
ENTP|Speaker McCarthy’s leadership and the House Republicans made history today. If the American people have to choose between the reasonable spending cuts of the McCarthy plan and the default extremism of Biden overwhelmingly they will demand negotiations.A huge step back to sanity
ENTP|The Wall Street Journal praises Nikki Haley for her position on abortion. @TeamHaley @NikkiHaley 
ENTP|No reason for President Trump to debate in the nominating process. Nixon and Reagan did not debate opponents in the primaries in 1972 and 1984. President Trump has nothing to gain and a lot to loose elevating candidates who are at 4% or less while letting hostile media attack him
ENTP|Based on the number of foreign transactions and instances of influence peddling by the Biden family, @AndrewCMcCarthy thinks Joe Biden should be disqualified from holding office. 
ENTP|House GOP have an impressive package of bills that will bring much needed transparency and competition to health care to lower costs and improve quality of care for American patients.

ENTP|New York City Dept. of Education will spend $38,000 per public school student next year, but with academic success being flat over the last 20 years - is this working? 
ENTP|China sent a warning to President Biden when a Chinese-American bank supplied Senate Republicans with records showing millions of dollars flowing from Chinese companies to Mr. Biden’s son Hunter Biden and brother James Biden. 
ENTP|The Republicans can offer a budget which has more economic growth, more take home pay, more safety for Medicare and Social Security, lower taxes, less spending, less debt, and therefore a lot less money spent on interest on the debt.

ENTP|Ill be on Americas Newsroom this morning at 900 am ET. Watch on @FoxNews @AmericaNewsroom @BillHemmer @DanaPerino
ENTP|Brazil and China to agree to a trade deal in the Chinese Yuan rather than the U.S. Dollar. This is what happens when the White House drives inflation, grows the debt, and projects weakness. 
ENTP|The motive behind the Donald Trump indictment is that he is still around – and could become president again. It is not about the law or anything rational. 
ENTP|The judge overseeing former President Donald Trump’s case my have violated New York’s Code of Judicial Conduct by making three donations to Democrats in 2020, which could lead to an ethics investigation, according to several legal experts. 
ENTP|As Donald Trump again dominates the news cycle, the legacy media has reverted to running its propaganda for the Democrats. Another great analysis by Mark Halperin - everyone should join his Substack. @MarkHalperin

ENTP|.@KLoeffler explains how progressive district attorneys are creating more unsafe cities rather than protecting their citizens. 
ENTP|The elite media and the more timid Republicans will promptly chant abortion, abortion when they should be looking into the source of $14.6 million and the reality that the left is in a life and death struggle to control America and sees the courts as a major battlefield.
ENTP|When a Wisconsin leftwing Democrat extremist outspends the Republican $14 million to $2.6 million in the Supreme Court race it is absurd to say abortion was the deciding issue.The decisive issue was the left’s willingness to spend nearly $6 for every $1 the Republican spent.
ENTP|The battle over the debt ceiling may be the indicator of the new pattern emerging in American politics and government. 
ENTP|It was a great pleasure to have @ShannonBream join my Newts World podcast to discuss her latest book, The Love Stories of the Bible Speak Biblical Lessons on Romance, Friendship, and Faith. 
ENTP|Mark levin is rightThe Democrat Party wants a one-party country, it wants a one-party system And its not an accident that this happens in Democrat cities, with Democrat judges, with Democrat prosecutors, with Democrat grand juries, and thats the way its going to work.
ENTP|Had a great meeting today with Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds. She is very very impressive and her achievements at modernizing state government and liberating education are remarkable. She is a real pioneer in improving government.
ENTP|If the Republicans focus on solutions the American people support, a large bloc of Democrats could help Republicans drive an increasingly successful Congress. 
ENTP|Dwight Weidman brilliantly outlines the incompetence of Joe Biden and his administration.

ENTP|72 percent of Americans favor increased oil and gas exploration. HR1 passage is another bipartisan victory for Speaker McCarthy.

ENTP|Great podcast with the impressive Ian Prior about his new book, Parents of the World, Unite! @iandprior 
ENTP|I agree with Speaker McCarthy on Waters I don’t think Republicans should go after one another. We need to bring this nation back. Bring Republicans in, independents, and Democrats too because we cannot handle four more years of Joe Biden. We can’t afford it.
ENTP|John Solomon’s report that the Pentagon has allocated $86.5 million for diversity and inclusion should give House Republicans an easy target for saving money. We oppose those policies and it would save over $1 billion over ten years.
ENTP|Lawmakers continue to press Pentagon officials to explain America’s ultimate goal in Ukraine and exactly how victory over Russia can be measured. 
ENTP|This is a smart, commonsense reform of probation rules with huge bipartisan support. The IA House passed it 93-1. The IA Senate should pass it promptly to get signed by the Governor. 
ENTP|PBSNC should stop stonewalling Marc Rotterman and restore his popular program Front Row with Marc Rotterman. @FrontRowmarc

ENTP|Lawmakers continue to press Pentagon officials to explain America’s ultimate goal in Ukraine and exactly how victory over Russia can be measured.

ENTP|Our Defense Department leadership doesn’t have a larger long-term strategy to deal with Russia, the war in Ukraine, or any of our other major challenges. 
ENTP|Biden and the Democrats think protecting Social Security and Medicare is their strength. It could become their Achilles heel if voters understand their tax increases and more regulations will weaken the long-term stability of the program. 
ENTP|This says it all – the left thinks parents aren’t smart enough to choose a good school for their children. I’m sure most Georgians disagree and trust parents. GA must pass school choice to empower parents to rescue their kids from bad schools! 
ENTP|Critical perspective for dangers of prescribing puberty blockers for children. @JohnKass 
ENTP|Legal experts believe Alvin Braggs case against President Trump doesnt have much legal merit. 
ENTP|While the public health rollout of COVID vaccines deserves scrutiny, Operation Warp Speed itself was a success. Now Sanders and big govt socialists say the taxpayer investment means the government can control private companies. Ridiculous and dangerous.

ENTP|With Russia stepping up its propaganda, the United States urgently needs a 21st-century communication strategy. @NatSecAnthony @ivanastradner 
ENTP|Like in Wag the Dog, the Democrats want to change the storyline when the financial system is collapsing, they are losing the wars in Europe and Asia, and the first family is revealed to be owned by China.
ENTP|A legal system which ignores millions in payments to the Biden family from China, Russia, Ukraine, Romania and elsewhere but focuses on Republicans over trivia is a system on the edge of collapse in public esteem and public support. It is sick. Americans will demand deep reforms.
ENTP|Arresting President Trump over a 2016 event which is of dubious illegality is another sign of the left’s insanity. To arrest a former and future President is an act of hatred and poison and will further harden support for Trump while discrediting the left. Remember Hunter Biden!
ENTP|Anyone who wants to protect Social Security and Medicare should reject President Joe Biden’s newly released budget.

ENTP|Speaker Kevin McCarthy and House Republicans have given the American people an opportunity to dramatically strengthen the role of parents in the education of their children. 
ENTP|The House Republicans Parents Bill of Rights is excellent. 
ENTP|The idea that bloggers criticizing a politician should register with the government is insane. it is an embarrassment that it is a Republican state legislator in Florida who introduced a bill to that effect. He should withdraw it immediately.
ENTP|We are living through the largest, deadliest scandal in American history, but the elite media refuses to connect the dots and analyze it. 
ENTP|House Republicans introduced their plan to empower parents with a Parents Bill of Rights. 
ENTP|American political leaders are suffering from China blindness.

ENTP|We are making progress on transparency of hospital prices. It is now time to get transparency of drug prices with PBM reform. @ChuckGrassley’s bill is a great step. 
ENTP|A key question Senators should ask Savings for whom? PBMs claim to save money on drugs but the discounts don’t pass through to patients at the pharmacy county. 
ENTP|The Congressional Budget Office projection that the debt will add $19 trillion in the next decade and $1.4 trillion this year going up to $2 trillion a year is proof we need a responsible debt ceiling with real reductions in spending. Biden bankruptcy plan to do nothing is wrong.

ENTP|Baltimore public schools are a grotesque example of where miseducation in America is leading. @RobertSWalker1 
ENTP|We dont need multiple National Anthems. Our Founding Fathers insisted that America was made up of people as a unified nation in which people worked together for the betterment of all. 
ENTP|These results fit into Americans’ longstanding preference for transparency and the growing bipartisan worry about the threat from Communist China as an economic and geopolitical rival to the United States.
ENTP|Calvin Coolidge proved how well America can work when its citizens and leaders follow a philosophy of limited government and freedom for all citizens. @amspectator

ENTP|A star is born could be the title of Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders absolutely remarkable speech responding to and drawing a sharp contrast with President Biden’s fantasy wish list state of the union. It was Reaganesque.
ENTP|From @RobertSWalker1, it is hard to fathom why the Chinese Communists would send a spy balloon across America. It might not be about us, it might also be about them. 
ENTP|It has been an exciting and productive opening month for House Republicans. They are keeping their commitments and making progress. 
ENTP|It will be difficult for Joe Biden to project any confidence about the state of our union after Americans just watched his woke, incompetent, and deeply confused national security team flounder over a single Chinese spy balloon. 
ENTP|Our national security and defense communities should not lose sight of some of the most critical threats from Russia and China are happening in Latin America. @carbonellt

ENTP|Ill be on Fox and Friends this morning at 730 am ET. Watch on @FoxNews.
ENTP|Every national security official who refused to protect America by shooting down the Chinese Communist Balloon should be fired today and replaced with people willing to defend America
ENTP|Defense experts warn that Chinese balloons can be the top ‘delivery platform’ for a nuclear EMP attack @SecretsBedard 
ENTP|Senior US defense and diplomatic officials do NOT want to shoot down the Chinese Communist balloon? Anthony Blinken,with $1 million a year from the Chinese funded Penn Biden Institute,protects the balloon instead of America. More madness. Americans should demand action.
ENTP|The Chinese Communist balloons could be trial runs for low visibility deliver of devastating EMP weapons. Read Bill Forstchen’s One Second After for a vivid, accurate demonstration of how devastating these balloons could be. This is madness.
ENTP|Since we only learned about the current Chinese Communist balloon because civilians saw it in Montana we have to ask how many balloons have there been that our government has not told us about? There are reports of a second balloon over Canada. Is it true?
ENTP|Some of our greatest educational institutions have been corrupted by foreign interests and money. We need a federal law that requires real-time, online publication of all foreign gifts to universities. 
ENTP|Speaker McCarthy has announced Congressman Juan Ciscomani will deliver the Republican address to the nation in Spanish. 
ENTP|Americans do not want a giant FBI, and given its current corruption and hostility to conservatives, Congress should kill this project. 
ENTP|It is wrong that New York Democrat lawmakers are so beholden to the powerful political teachers’ union that they cant provide more school choices for parents.
ENTP|Flashback to 2011, when nearly every Democrat leader was willing to negotiate on limits to the debt ceiling.

ENTP|Rep. Chris Smith will look to expose Chinas human-rights abuses as the chairman of the new House-Senate bipartisan commission on China. 
ENTP|Bidens Justice Department opening a civil rights investigation into the death of Tyre Nichols makes no sense - in fact it could make things worse. From @AndrewCMcCarthy 
ENTP|Americans understand we have a spending problem in Washington. President Biden should begin negotiations with Speaker McCarthy immediately to put us on a sustainable path.

ENTP|Perfection in our country will never be achieved, but the freedom to strive for perfection through thoughtful debate is worth celebrating and what should make us all proud to be Americans. Great piece from my daughter. @jackiecushman 
ENTP|Thank you, Joan, and it was wonderful to be in Italy to celebrate your birthday with you. I hope you enjoy the book. 
ENTP|This weekend, pre order a copy of my new book and receive a free membership to my Inner Circle! Just head over to for more information, or to claim your free membership! 
ENTP|Kathy Barnette should be very proud of her run for Senate and will be an important voice in the conservative movement.
ENTP|Great to chat with Michael Pack, on my latest podcast, about his documentary and new book, written with Mark Paoletta, Created Equal Clarence Thomas In His Own Words. 
ENTP|Americans need to reject the policy failures of Presidents Jimmy Carter and Joe Biden and restore the economic results Presidents Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump gave them. Read my latest 
ENTP|With fewer than 150 days until the midterms, the Big Government Socialists are trying to shift the narrative focus away from the administrations inability to curb inflation. 
ENTP|The Supreme Courts decision to overturn Roe v. Wade demonstrated the importance of President Donald Trumps influence on the judicial branch. 
ENTP|As gasoline and diesel fuel prices continue to reach levels that are causing real pain to American families and real damage to the economy, President Biden and his administration have been floundering around in their fantasy world. 
ENTP|The Civics Secures Democracy Act is an idea being put forward by Big Government Socialist and radical left-wing nuts. No Republican should support it. In fact, every Republican should oppose it severely. 
ENTP|The success of Top Gun Maverick demonstrates that Americans dont want wokeness in their entertainment and sports. 
ENTP|With the fluctuations in our economy happening on a near-daily basis, it is a good time for state and local governments to ensure that financial literacy is part of an education curriculum. @jackiecushman 
ENTP|The University of Michigan Consumer Confidence survey just hit the lowest number in the history of the survey going back to 1952. Some 79% of consumers expect bad economic times in the next year. One more signal Big Government Socialism is not working and Democrats will pay
ENTP|If our government could balance the budget, cut bureaucracy, and eliminate unnecessary regulation and red tape, it could create a new rebirth for entrepreneurs and small businesses. 
ENTP|Shrinkflation is not new, however, during the Biden presidency, it is becoming more common. 
ENTP|As Russia continues attacking Ukraine, China continues to cement ties with the Kremlin. 
ENTP|Pretty remarkable story on world largest 3D printer being used to build homes in Virginia. 
ENTP|The recent Texas House Special Election win forecasts shifting demographics and a gloomy November for Democrats 
ENTP|Nevadans flee the Democrat Party in droves for the GOP. 
ENTP|Ill be joining Jesse Watters Primetime coming up at 700 pm ET. Watch on @FoxNews @jesseprimetime @JesseBWatters
ENTP|.@MikeCollinsGA is exactly the person that folks in #GA10 need fighting for them in Washington. Get out and vote for Mike in todays runnoff.
ENTP|.@JakeEvansGA is a patriot, a proven leader, and a close friend. I couldnt think of a better person to take over my old seat in #GA6. Go support Jake today.
ENTP|Anyone in #GA2 who wants to see a smart, energetic, and principled leader represent them in Washington should go vote for @thejeremyhunt in todays runoff.
ENTP|Ill be on The Ingraham Angle tonight at 1000 pm ET. Watch on @FoxNews @IngrahamAngle
ENTP|Higher prices on food and gas are driving thousands of Californians to Mexico. 
ENTP|Ill be talking about my new book, Defeating Big Government Socialism Saving Americas Future on Talk Shop Live at 6 p.m. Eastern today. Please be sure to watch - and get an autographed copy. 
ENTP|Ill be on Fox and Friends this morning at 720 am ET. Watch on @FoxNews.
ENTP|The Biden administration issued more than 75 new regulatory actions before SpaceXs next rocket launch can take place. This is how Democrats kill American innovation! 
ENTP|Big Government Socialism has taken over the modern Democratic Party, big business, news media, entertainment, and academia. Join me at 6 p.m. Eastern tomorrow on Talk Shop Live to talk about how we can save America. 
ENTP|The prices you are paying at the gas pump are a function of Big Government Socialism’s hopelessly wrong ideological and theological rejection of reality – and preference for fantasies that do not work in the real world. 
ENTP|No red wave in 2022-with 87% agreeing we need to restore the America that works we will have a red, white, and blue wave of a New American Majority drowning the Big Government Socialist-woke coalition much bigger than a Republican red wave
ENTP|Please help Asma, who escaped Afghanistan in September of last year. She bravely faced the Taliban and helped coordinate the evacuation of 150 of her female classmates. This coming semester she will be attending Virginia Tech. 
ENTP|Ill be on Hannity tonight at 900 pm ET. Watch on @FoxNews @seanhannity
ENTP|Excited about my latest podcast. It is with Dr. Steve Brusatte about his new book, The Rise and Reign of the Mammals, and the new film, Jurassic World Dominion. 
ENTP|The Republican Study Committee’s new report on balancing the federal budget in 7 years is worth reading As i point out in my new book, Defeating Big Government Socialism, balancing the federal budget is a vital goal. The RSC has taken a big first step
ENTP|Join me on Talk Shop Live at 6 p.m. Eastern on June 20. Ill be talking about - and offering autographed copies of - my new book, Defeating Big Government Socialism Saving Americas Future. 
ENTP|President Reagan demonstrated to Americans with the Economic Recovery Tax Act that both political parties could work together for a collective goal - to reduce inflation. The current clueless administration could learn from his legacy. 
ENTP|Bidens inflation is preventing police from having the resources they need to respond to non-emergency calls. 
ENTP|Democrats everywhere should be terrified by yesterday’s Republican victory in the South Texas special election. Zapatista County swung 38 points toward Trump between 2016 and 2020. Former Democrat strongholds voted heavily Republican. If the pattern continues nationally —wow
ENTP|Ill be on The Ingraham Angle tonight at 1000 pm ET. Watch on @FoxNews @IngrahamAngle
ENTP|Did you know in 1949 National Flag Day was established by an Act of Congress? Find out more at #flagpoleoffreedom #FlagDay
ENTP|The Jan. 6 Committee propaganda primetime show had nothing in common with legitimate congressional hearings. Instead, it was a show trial worthy of Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin. 
ENTP|The power of prayer is a constant reminder of what our nation needs during a troubling time—a great piece from my daughter Jackie. @jackiecushman 
ENTP|Ill be on Fox and Friends this morning at 720 am ET. Watch on @FoxNews.
ENTP|With the growing supply chain shortages and questions over election integrity, the Biden administration is turning America into the Soviet Union of the 1990s. 
ENTP|Ill be on The Ingraham Angle tonight at 1000 pm ET. Watch on @FoxNews @IngrahamAngle
ENTP|High test at our local gas station is $5.899 this morning and joe biden goes on jimmy kimmel! Hard to laugh at this disaster
ENTP|Ill be on Hannity tonight at 900 pm ET. Watch on @FoxNews @seanhannity
ENTP|I was delighted to be joined for my latest podcast by my friend @KellyannePolls to discuss her fantastic new book, Here’s the Deal, A Memoir. 
ENTP|President Joe Biden’s supposed effort to build back better has degenerated into build back poorer for the American people and build back broke for the American government. 
ENTP|The false attacks on Jake Evans are laughable. A 10-year-old academic paper is simply irrelevant. Don’t be fooled. Vote @jakeevansga as your Trump-endorsed Constitutional Warrior for #GA6
ENTP|Concerned about your retirement and investments? Join me for a virtual town hall with Charles Thorngren, CEO of @LegacyGoldIRA on Tuesday, June 7 at 500pm ET. Register now, space is limited 
ENTP|Ill be on Fox and Friends this morning at 730 am ET. Watch on @FoxNews.
ENTP|Callista’s shock at paying $104.50 to fill up her car is a reminder that the Biden build back poorer program is hurting all Americans. We need to make America affordable again.
ENTP|Kellyanne Conway’s new book, Here’s the Deal is a wonderfully human memoir from one of the most important strategist-consultant pollsters in America today. You will find it engrossing and extraordinary-she writes as well as she talks-and that is saying a lot.
ENTP|Democrats in swing districts keep getting weaker. @HOTLINEJOSH 
ENTP|Ill be on Hannity tonight at 900 pm ET. Watch on @FoxNews @seanhannity
ENTP|Ill be on Fox and Friends this morning at 730 am ET. Watch on @FoxNews.
ENTP|If they are strategic and can work together, both McCormick and Dr. Oz can still win the senate seat for the Republicans in the fall. 
ENTP|Queen Elizabeth is a truly historic figure. There is something amazing and fascinating about her dedication and loyalty to serving her country at the highest level for 70 years. 
ENTP|Check out Kash Patels new childrens book - The Plot Against the King. Very entertaining. image attached 
ENTP|Ill be on The Ingraham Angle tonight at 1000 pm ET. Watch on @FoxNews @IngrahamAngle
ENTP|The United States, under a U.N. resolution, should protect the flow of goods in the Black Seas and block any opportunities for the Russians to seize 100% control. @bingwest 
ENTP|Ill be on Hannity tonight at 900 pm ET. Watch on @FoxNews @seanhannity
ENTP|The global food supply shortage, heightened by the Ukraine war, will be a massive humanitarian crisis. @JamesGRickards 
ENTP|Salena Zitos excellent column is a stark reminder that Americans vote with their pocketbooks, not by party affiliation. 
ENTP|That Robby Mook implicated Clinton during the Michael Sussmann trial is a real bombshell for the deep ties between her 2016 campaign and the Russian hoax. @JonathanTurley 
ENTP|I’ve known Jake Evans for many years. Hes a hard-working, courageous, and intelligent young man who can lead the fight against the Biden administration and get America turned around. Vote for @JakeEvansGA!
ENTP|Speaker Pelosi and her Big Government Socialist followers claim historically high gasoline and diesel fuel prices – caused by President Joe Biden’s assault on the oil and gas industry – can be undone by government price controls. They are wrong. 
ENTP|Ill be on Fox and Friends this morning at 730 am ET. Watch on @FoxNews.
ENTP|Inspiring article on the generosity of @MissionBBQ to @HonorFlightNet, supporting our heroes in the U.S. armed forces. 
ENTP|More than $163 billion in unemployment-related payments have been lost to fraud. 
ENTP|Dick Armey is an American patriot. Outstanding review of his book by @TheRoffDraft. 
ENTP|For my latest podcast, I talk with Dr. Ben Carson about his new book, Created Equal The Painful Past, Confusing Present, and Hopeful Future of Race in America. @realbencarson 
ENTP|The latest LSAT questionnaire is an excellent example of the insidious, pro-radical lifestyle biases and prejudices introduced at every level of American society. 
ENTP|I highly recommend @realbencarson’s fantastic new book, Created Equal. Dr. Carson is a brilliant patriot and his book applies common sense solutions to the problems our country faces today. 
ENTP|In my latest podcast, I talk with Bill O’Reilly about his new book, Killing the Killers The Secret War Against Terrorists. @BillOReilly 
ENTP|.@VDHanson latest commentary best sums up the insanity we are living through under the Biden administration. 
ENTP|Democrats claimed their position on abortion has overwhelming American support, but their bill was filled with provisions that the American people deeply opposed. 
ENTP|Pretty remarkable that the world’s first private space academy is opening in Lone Tree, Colorado. 
ENTP|Elon Musk is right @elonmusk In the past I voted Democrat, because they were (mostly) the kindness party. But they have become the party of division , hate, so I can no longer support them and will vote Republican.
ENTP|Not a good look for Gov. Kemp to have a relationship with a Soros-funded project. @AaronKliegman 
ENTP|Ill be on Hannity tonight at 900 pm ET. Watch on @FoxNews @seanhannity
ENTP|The red tsunami that exists at the state and local levels should reach the federal level after this falls midterms. Americans have seen enough of the devastation of Democrats wasteful spending policies. @MatureAmericans 
ENTP|Our country doesnt need a Disinformation Governance Board when our President and his administration cant tell the truth. @JohnKass 
ENTP|Everyone in #GA6 should get out to vote for Jake Evans for Congress. @JakeEvansGA 
ENTP|Radicals are seizing control of the Democrat Party and people are leaving. In Nevada, four times as many Democrats have switched to the GOP since May. 
ENTP|Ill be on Fox and Friends this morning at 730 am ET. Watch on @FoxNews.
ENTP|The Democrats’ latest healthcare plan still doesnt support the patient. 
ENTP|Americans must decide whether to continue to ignore the decay of the left’s insanely destructive policies, or, whether the time has come to reassert the right of citizens to expect personal safety as the first responsibility of government. Read my latest 
ENTP|It is insane that, once again, the Biden administration has prioritized the needs of illegal immigrants over American citizens. @SecretsBedard 
ENTP|Ill be on Hannity tonight at 900 pm ET. Watch on @FoxNews @seanhannity
ENTP|The latest report of the Producer Price Index reaching a record level of inflation reaffirms that this administration has no clue about the causes of or solutions for inflation. 
ENTP|Ill be on The Ingraham Angle tonight at 1000 pm ET. Watch on @FoxNews @IngrahamAngle
ENTP|The Party of Death is bringing up a bill in the Senate which is more radical and more anti-life than Roe versus Wade. This bill would be overwhelmingly rejected by the American people if they knew what was in it.Every Democrat who votes yes is putting their reelection at risk.
ENTP|.@VDHanson makes the case that someday, even the liberals in California will have had enough of radicals who are destroying their state. 
ENTP|￼ Biden speech in context Overall CPI +8.3% since last year Gas +43.6% Electricity +11% Meat, Poultry, , Fish +13.8% Milk +14.7% Eggs +22.6% Coffee +13.5% Used Cars +22.7% Airline Fares +33.3% Real Average Hourly Earnings -2.6%
ENTP|The fight for womens rights has come a long way, but now the radical Left wants to erase the effort in the name of wokeism. 
ENTP|Important podcast from @Reinsch84 with Gordon Wood about his new book Power and Liberty Constitutionalism in the American Revolution. 
ENTP|I’m proud to endorse Gen. John King for Georgias Insurance Commissioner. Gen. King will take on corruption, the status quo, and special interests as your Insurance Commissioner. We MUST elect rock-solid conservatives to keep Georgia moving in the right direction.
ENTP|Bernard Cornwell is an amazing novelist of historic events. I just finished his Last Kingdom series and found it both entertaining and educational. His series on Sharpe in the napoleonic wars is amazing. I recommend Cornwell to anyone interested in learning while enjoying.
ENTP|The Number One question for President Biden’s press conference should be the crisis in baby formula. I just talked with a woman who had been driving all over looking for baby formula. One more example of the totally messed up logistics system which Biden has failed to fix
ENTP|Ill be on Fox and Friends this morning at 730 am ET. Watch on @FoxNews.
ENTP|As we celebrate Mother’s Day, we should be aware that the holiday could someday come to an end. Don’t be fooled, the effort to replace the word mother with birthing person is already underway. 
ENTP|I have known Mike Coan for many years and I encourage Georgia voters to support Mike Coan for Labor Commissioner in the Republican Primary. Please vote early or on May 24th for Mike Coan. 
ENTP|Democrats are increasingly abandoning their party in support of the Republican platform. This great party migration conveys American voters general dissatisfaction and disappointment with the Biden administration. @gingrich360 
ENTP|As Joel Ross notes Productivity was down 7.5% and labor costs up 11.7%. Those numbers are dreadful, and the worst since 1947. the escalating destructiveness of Biden’s Big Government Socialism is just going to get worse and the American people will pay for bad government.
ENTP|In my latest podcast, I follow up on my four-part series on how our country has an opportunity to bring together a large American majority – rather than a narrow Republican majority. 
ENTP|The current uproar over the leaked draft from the U.S. Supreme Court deliberations over abortion is, in some ways, a lot of noise about the inevitable. 
ENTP|Impactful essay by @bdomenech, I encourage everyone to read it. 
ENTP|Speaking with @dagenmcdowell this morning at 800 AM on @FoxBusiness Channel. Tune in! @MorningsMaria
ENTP|Ill be on Hannity tonight at 900 pm ET. Watch on @FoxNews @seanhannity
ENTP|If conservatives can build a performance-based message on the themes of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, we can govern with a long-term, stable American majority rather than a shorter-lived Republican majority. 
ENTP|Ill be on Fox and Friends this morning at 730 am ET. Watch on @FoxNews.
ENTP|As the 2022 midterm elections and the 2024 presidential election draw near, American voters should be concerned about big tech accountability. 
ENTP|To the 30K returning followers, you may have missed this President Reagan’s calm, steady determination to shape history and defeat the hostile Soviet Union contrasts with the Biden administration’s pathetic, floundering confusion and dishonesty. 
ENTP|An amazing story of an American former refugee of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan working to fight for Ukraine. 
ENTP|For all my return followers who are no longer shadow-banned by Twitter The best way to understand the current extraordinarily dangerous tragedy in Ukraine is to imagine a fight between a bear, a lion, and a bunny rabbit.

ESFJ|For me, its all about feeling confident in your skin, no matter what. Thats why working with the best chemists in top labs to bring you a formula that could do just that and deliver real results was so important to me. This is seriously sexy science. @JLoBeauty 
ESFJ|We give all this care and attention to the skin on our face, but we sometimes neglect the body. It was important to me to create a skincare routine for the body to address its specific and unique needs, and we started with the booty!

ESFJ|Getting my outfits together for the weekend… 
ESFJ|I will remember you always. Sending so much love and strength to your daughter Karsen, your family and all your loved ones. 5/5
ESFJ|Like a raw nerve, he was so accessible and so in touch in his acting and I will always remember our time together fondly. We lost a great today … RIP RAY … it’s so sad to lose you what seems way to soon … 4/5
ESFJ|… and we both knew this was going to be good. We enjoyed doing our scenes together and I felt lucky to have him there to work with and learn from. Like all artists he was complicated, sincere, honest and so very emotional. 3/5
ESFJ|We shared some intense moments on set those three years! When I first heard he took the job on Shades of Blue I was thrilled, and the first time we walked on set to do our first scene together there was an electric spark and a mutual respect … 2/5
ESFJ|Ray was my partner in crime on Shades of Blue … the first thing that comes to mind is he so was kind to my children. Ray was the epitome of a tough guy who was all mushy on the inside … I guess that’s what made him such a compelling actor to watch. The original Goodfella. 1/5 
ESFJ|I can’t think of anything more cruel or diabolical than to target small children. God help us!!! We need some serious change!!! And we need it NOW!!! 3/3
ESFJ|I am so sad and scared for our kids and loved ones. I’m scared for all of us who send our children to school every day or going to grocery store!! My heart goes out to all of those who have been impacted by this unimaginable act!! 2/3
ESFJ|Broken-hearted… I’ve been so emotional and crying a lot the since I heard the news about these beautiful children and teachers. Along with so many others, I’m demanding for law makers to stop the violence that is happening across this country!!! Our country!! 1/3

ESFJ|My condolences to the Trump family for the loss of the beautiful and gracious Ivana. She was the first Trump I met, back in 1996, when she came to Alaska. I remember standing in line in Anchorage at the J.C. Penney store to meet her during an event to promote her new perfume.
ESFJ|Thank you Secretary @mikepompeo. What an honor! @cavpac 🇺🇸 
ESFJ|Dennis was a well respected Alaskan , lawmaker who loved his community. It was an honor to have the opportunity to appoint him to the Senate in 2009, where he continued to make a difference until 2018. The Egan family truly helped shape Alaska. My prayers are w/the family.-Sarah

ESFJ|(2/2) And to any insincere, fake DC patriots used as PLANTS - you will be found out.
ESFJ|Media quit labeling DC protestors Conservatives, Republicans, Tea Partiers, Trump Supporters, etc LOOK IN TO WHO THESE PEOPLE ARE who’d choose an apparent leaderless insane swarm to create a perception of condoned violence. KNOCK IT OFF. (1/2)

ESFJ|@AOC nar·cis·sist /ˈnärsəsəst/ @AOC Listen sweetie, you know how many of us waitressed through high school to save up for college? Then waitressed and blue-collared throughout to get our degrees? You know how many hard working, selfless American workers cont to do so?
ESFJ|I finally agree with this chick! Hey @AOC , you’re right when you cry In a moral society (no American worker) should be too poor to live. Amen sista’🙌So stop stealing , giving their money to able-bodied individuals refusing to work.

ESFJ|Imagine if Hunters last name was Palin or Bush or Trump 🧐
ESFJ|God help society if this is accepted by any of you. 
ESFJ|I offer experience showing a biased, intolerant, sexist medium full of left-wing activists, not rational, credible journalists. Consider the source. - Sarah Palin
ESFJ|and so many other family members, and in general it’d show the disparager unfit to tie our vets’ combat boots. But before agreeing with The Atlantic’s latest claim that our Commander in Chief grossly disrespects our military,
ESFJ|2) The Atlantic is the rag that led and pushed fake news that Trig is not actually my son. Deluded with their claim that I faked my pregnancy for political gain, this clan was obsessed with obtaining my private medical records, 
ESFJ|1) Never, EVER trust anonymous sources. If someone doesn’t have the cojones to go on the record or provide hard facts, good chance they’re flat out lying. Cowards.
ESFJ|The Atlantic holds a special place in my heart. After years bloodied in the media meat grinder - but still resolutely standing - my thoughts on this week’s news to consider, considering the source 
ESFJ|Humbled and thankful. 
ESFJ|Apologies beforehand for these sketchy looking FaceTime remote interviews-it is what it is w/media’s inconsistent protocols during overreaction to Covid🙄 See you tonight!
ESFJ|@donnabrazile , I do Fox tonight 7pm EST w/Martha MacCallum. Enjoyable working together 🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏾‍♀️ opposite sides of political aisle but shared passion for things like 🏀! 
ESFJ|GMA 3am Alaska, up to talk exclusive #ClubOf3 female Veep candidates 🇺🇸 with #ClubOf3Dogs yapping , nipping at my heels ~ literally ~ throughout interview (the more things change the more they stay the same🤣) 
ESFJ|We just want TRUTH. On BOTH sides. What a dangerous time for humanity when media can not be trusted and conclusions are jumped to - on either side - based on bias. Dangerous. - Sarah Palin 
ESFJ|So much noise about potentially nebulous things distracting from issues that MUST be dealt with in order to have justice, equality and peace.
ESFJ|ABHORRENT if true any act of racism like this is cowardly, disgusting, unacceptable. But is it true. Don’t you wish we could trust the press? Can’t we just be told TRUTH? 
ESFJ|Joining other Masked alumni tonight to shout Thank You to all of the nation’s frontline crisis workers. #TheMaskedSinger #ThanksYou 
ESFJ|Tune in TONIGHT @MaskedSingerFox #TheMaskedSinger #RoadToTheFinals and then catch the finale and the Season 3 Winner crowned TOMORROW! 
ESFJ|Our hearts go out to the friends, family and NBC colleagues of Larry Edgeworth. Larry was a valued member of our rag-tag B-team 2008 campaign plane. We will remember his graciousness, sense of humor, , calming presence behind the scenes. Larry will be missed. - SP 
ESFJ|Death Panels. See what I meant? So what if you like your doctor you’re still SOL. So Obamacare rules better be scrapped ASAP, politicians step aside before it’s too late, let medical experts work unhindered. Then, the fearless America we know will prevail. America Strong! -SP
ESFJ|Figured I’d do it because, well, this is America! And don’t you have to conquer a major reality show before big-time politics?! 😊 - SP #TheMaskedSinger
ESFJ|🙈Yep t’was me behind the #BearMask, I LOVED singing on The Masked Singer stage ~ it truly was a blast (now that it’s over!!) Great to work with the BEST producers , crew, many of whom have been so good to our family over the years. 
ESFJ|TOO unbelievably sad 💔

ESFP|My clear conscious will thereby allow me to await with tranquillity the results of any and all investigations.
ESFP|I firmly deny the accusations being issued against me. Rape is an abominable crime that goes against everything that I am and believe in. Keen as I may be to clear my name, I refuse to feed the media spectacle created by people seeking to promote themselves at my expense.
ESFP|Aguardarei com tranquilidade o resultado de quaisquer investigações e processos, pois nada me pesa na consciência.
ESFP|Nego terminantemente as acusações de que sou alvo. Considero a violação um crime abjecto, contrário a tudo aquilo que sou e em que acredito. Não vou alimentar o espectáculo mediático montado por quem se quer promover à minha custa.

ESTJ|Endometriosis affects millions of women and girls. But we dont talk about it. Im proud to have been an executive producer of Below the Belt, a documentary airing on PBS on June 21 that breaks the silence. Dont miss this moving, informative, and infuriating film. 
ESTJ|Wishing you a joyful Juneteenth! Lets keep working for justice, equality, and an America where every child has the chance to live up to his or her God-given potential.⁣ ⁣ Photo Kathy Williams, Reuters⁣ 
ESTJ|I was a big fan of Glenda Jackson, both as an actor and as a politician. She was an epic talent, a passionate advocate, and simply extraordinary. You can hear a conversation we had a few years ago here about her incredible life and career. 
ESTJ|Sixty years on from the Equal Pay Act, we can and must do better than this. 
ESTJ|An important book is out today The Power Code by @ClaireShipman and @KattyKay. Power is not working—for women, for men, or for the world. Heres the recipe book for how to remake it. 
ESTJ|I appreciate you so much, my friend. Indeed, here’s to justice.
ESTJ|Bringing this back in light of recent news Get a limited-edition But Her Emails hat and support @onwardtogether groups working to strengthen our democracy. 
ESTJ|Take a look at the new trailer for @HiddenLightPrd’s documentary, In the Shadow of Beirut, which shares the story of four families in Lebanon over four years. The film just won best international feature at New Zealand’s Doc Edge Festival. 
ESTJ|Exactly this.
ESTJ|New merch in the @onwardtogether store LGBTQ rights are human rights. Grab a shirt or tote to show your Pride, and support groups working for equality and dignity for all. 
ESTJ|Thanks to President Bidens bipartisan debt ceiling deal ✅ Social Security checks will go out on time ✅Veterans who risked their lives for our nation will get the benefits they deserve ✅Our nation’s most vulnerable will continue to have access to the health care they need
ESTJ|Care work makes all other work possible. Take some time for this great conversation with @aijenpoo, of @onwardtogether partner @domesticworkers, about how to make the care economy work for everyone.
ESTJ|Remembering today the millions of Americans who’ve served our country in the military across generations, as well as their families—and especially those who lost their lives defending our freedom.
ESTJ|Love this from @reshmasaujani Imposter syndrome isn’t my problem to solve. And it isn’t yours, either.
ESTJ|So grateful today to be with @ForRecovery, an incredible partner with @ClintonGlobal and @DirectRelief in getting 20,000 doses of naloxone into the community in Nevada. Thanks, Las Vegas, for the warm welcome—it’s always wonderful to be here! 
ESTJ|Congressional Republicans claim their debt limit hostage-taking is motivated by concerns about fiscal responsibility. But new CBO estimates show their plan to extend the Trump tax cuts without paying for them would add $3.5 trillion to the debt over the next 10 years. Oops!
ESTJ|Eighty-six percent of transgender and nonbinary young people have said the recent raft of anti-trans bills have negatively affected their mental health. Yesterdays #TransProm was a beautiful, defiant demonstration of the joy of being exactly who you are. 
ESTJ|Ron DeSantiss ultra-MAGA Florida isnt safe for people of color, LGBTQ+ people, or even multi-billion dollar corporations. 
ESTJ|Lets be clear Extreme MAGA Republicans are refusing to pay America’s bills. And theyre threatening default in the hopes of achieving cuts to critical programs that they could never get through the normal democratic process. Its economic hostage-taking.
ESTJ|Thank you to @MaraWebster and the @TelevisionAcad for a wonderful conversation about Gutsy, our @AppleTV+ series. Shining a light on the inspirational stories of women all over the world is an absolute privilege, and its been a profound gift to do it with @ChelseaClinton. 
ESTJ|We cannot allow MAGA Republicans to tank our economy.
ESTJ|Be there with bells on!
ESTJ|A beautiful post-Mothers Day read Ashley Judd on her late mother, Naomi, and how shes learned to make this irreplaceable loss serve her mothers legacy. 
ESTJ|If MAGA Republicans force a default, the catastrophe consequences for our economy could include 🚨6 million jobs lost 🚨The unemployment rate surging to over 7% 🚨Plummeting stock prices, threatening millions of Americans retirement savings 
ESTJ|An Idaho mother faced two options Continue a pregnancy likely to end in miscarriage or stillbirth, with risks to her own health, or travel out of state for an abortion. These stories are playing out all over the country. 
ESTJ|Big Tech companies like Google are putting Americans reproductive rights at risk. Watch a new video from @onwardtogether partner @accountabletech about how we can change that.
ESTJ|I cant stop thinking about this beautiful young family, murdered with an AR-15 style rifle while running errands. Ban assault weapons now.
ESTJ|@JustinTrudeau ❤️🇨🇦

ESTJ|Technology only truly works if benefits people and society. We need strong regulation at the outset to ensure that it does. AI is no exception.

ESTJ|I hope youll join my dear friends Kitty Higgins, @MelanneVerveer, @NancySoderberg, and Susan Brophy on Monday for a discussion about the incredible women who helped bring peace to Northern Ireland.
ESTJ|President Biden will never force middle class and working families to bear the burden of tax cuts for the wealthiest — which is exactly what MAGA Republicans just voted to do. 
ESTJ|Joe and Kamala are the best people for the job of defending our democracy, fighting for our rights, and making sure everyone has a fair shot. Join me in becoming a part of their re-election campaign, starting today. 
ESTJ|Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy is making a ransom demand. His hostage is the economy and America’s credibility. Read my view of the debt ceiling debate at @nytopinion 
ESTJ|My most profound hope for my grandchildren, and for every child, is that they have the chance to live up to their God-given potential. To do it, theyll need a healthy planet. This Earth Day, lets recommit to leaving them a thriving place to reach for their dreams. 
ESTJ|The good news you might not yet have heard this week President Biden just took transformational action for American families. Congratulations to all the advocates for access to child care and long-term care, including many @onwardtogether partners. 💚

ESTJ|Sharing this mantra for anyone who needs to hear it!
ESTJ|Can’t wait to meet the first group of Scholars!

ESTJ|What a joy to join a special screening of Lyra this weekend in Belfast. More people should know about the life, death, and lasting legacy of journalist Lyra McKee. Im grateful @HiddenLightPrd has been a part of sharing her story. Photos @HardPinMedia 
ESTJ|So thrilled to be here to mark this moment and look ahead to whats next in the ongoing work for peace.
ESTJ|Please share.
ESTJ|What Sen. @CoryBooker said. 
ESTJ|Thats right—were bringing back the Macarena.
ESTJ|Neither our Founders—nor prior generations of Supreme Court Justices or members of Congress—would believe what is being done to our children in the name of the Bill of Rights. Shameful.
ESTJ|Next week, Ill have the honor of recognizing 25 women from across the political and civic spectrum who have helped further the cause of peace in Northern Ireland and beyond. #Agreement25 
ESTJ|You (truly) love to see it.
ESTJ|Read this today to believe that hope is real, change is possible, and conflicts can end. An important message for Passover, Easter and the future. 
ESTJ|Wishing a happy Easter to everyone celebrating! 
ESTJ|We dont have to put up with these shockingly anti-democratic actions that deny voters voices and aim to cut off the progress we need. You can stand with expelled Reps. Justin Jones and Justin Pearson by donating to their re-election campaigns here 
ESTJ|Following yet another school shooting, Tennessee Republicans have moved on from offering empty thoughts and prayers in place of action. Now theyve expelled two Democratic legislators who demanded safety for students and educators who just want to learn and teach in peace.
ESTJ|To everyone marking Passover today, chag sameach. Wishing you a joyous celebration of freedom with family and friends.
ESTJ|There have been 135 mass shootings so far this year in America. Its barely April. Ban assault weapons now.

ESTJ|When it comes to gun violence, MAGA Republicans are clear theyre not gonna fix it.
ESTJ|We had an assault weapons ban from 1994-2004 that prohibited the manufacture or sale for civilian use of certain semi-automatic weapons and banned magazines with 10 rounds or more. Mass shootings dropped during that decade. We did it once and should do it again.
ESTJ|This Women’s History Month, remember we’re not just fighting against attacks on our rights. We are fighting for a future where everyone has the opportunity to live up to his or her potential. 
ESTJ|One party is trying to make Americans lives better. The other party is trying to distract Americans from the fact that theyre not even trying.
ESTJ|What Tammy said.
ESTJ|Looking forward to meeting you, @columbia students!
ESTJ|Girls in Afghanistan should be going back to school tomorrow, but the Taliban is only allowing boys to be educated. #LetAfghanGirlsLearn 
ESTJ|If we want to keep the planet habitable for our kids and grandkids, the worlds leading climate scientists say, we need to act now. Later will be too late. 
ESTJ|Women in states with abortion bans are nearly three times more likely to die during pregnancy, childbirth or soon after giving birth. Read that sentence again. 
ESTJ|I so enjoyed reflecting with @GIWPS yesterday on the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement and the courage and hard work it all took. You can watch the full event here 
ESTJ|If you want to elect leaders who will support teachers and doctors—not ban books and cut off care—apply to Arena Academy (an @onwardtogether partner!). They’ll help you get trained, get hired, and get to work electing Dems up and down the ballot.

ESTJ|Next month, the Wisconsin Supreme Court election will determine the future of reproductive rights for millions. @JanetForJustice is the progressive candidate who believes women should be able to make their own health care decisions. Help elect her 
ESTJ|Ill be hosting a conference at @QUBelfast next month to reflect on 25 years of the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement. Civic leaders who have contributed to peace and reconciliation will join @BillClinton and me to take stock of this historic turning point. 
ESTJ|Our democracy needs us to be joiners! Happy to have been interviewed for @JoinOrDieFilm, premiering at @sxsw this weekend, to share this urgent message. See the trailer below 
ESTJ|As @POTUS says, show us your budget and well see what you really value. A new analysis finds the Republican Study Committees formal budget proposal would slash Medicare by a drastic 24%.

ESTJ|Judy Heumann’s lifelong advocacy for the rights and dignity of people with disabilities made the world a better place for everyone. She served under Bill’s administration and with me at State, and her voice will be much missed. 
ESTJ|Thank you to @aijenpoo, @dmariscal, and @bradleyml for helping equip the students of #CGIU2023 with the tools they need to lead!
ESTJ|I always find so much sense in what you say, @SecretaryPete. Thanks for joining #CGIU2023 to address the next generation of leaders.

ESTJ|Reminder Most people in most states support a persons right to get a legal abortion. 
ESTJ|Expanding domestic production of the logic and memory chips that power our devices is a national and economic security imperative. @SecRaimondo is leading the way with a blueprint for implementation. This is smart industrial policy for the 21st century. 
ESTJ|This weekend is going to be jam-packed with inspiring conversations, big ideas, and fresh solutions – see you in Nashville, @CGIU!
ESTJ|Over two years, the Biden administration and Senate have confirmed 97 judges who strengthen our courts with their personal , professional experience. ☑️3/4 are women ☑️2/3 are people of color ☑️1/4 were public defenders Read the @civilrightsorg report 
ESTJ|Happy birthday to my biking companion, travel buddy, co-author, producing partner, fellow advocate, and darling, darling, daughter. 
ESTJ|The attacks on Rep. Judy Chu are false, racist, and xenophobic. All people of conscience should stand together to say so.
ESTJ|I add my voice to the chorus of people and institutions expressing concern for Azerbaijani activist Bakhtiyar Hajiyev. Hes on hunger strike to protest his detention since December on politically-motivated charges, and his condition is deteriorating. The world is watching.
ESTJ|Dont look away from the horror that extreme anti-choice judges and politicians have forced on families across the country. Dont stop fighting to restore reproductive freedom. 
ESTJ|Riding on a train to the front lines of the fight for democracy? Peak Biden. #RailForceOne 
ESTJ|Millions of Americans have depression. Some of them are in Congress. @JohnFetterman has shown leadership in sharing his experience and has doubtless helped others by talking publicly about seeking treatment. Wishing him a swift recovery.
ESTJ|New for Galentines (and Valentines) Shirts to make a statement about your love of human rights (and voting). Like everything in our Shop, its union-made and proceeds support our progressive partners.

ESTJ|.@TimothyDSnyder is a preeminent expert on democracy. When he sounds the alarm on threats we havent fully addressed, we should all listen. Read this piece. 
ESTJ|I’m going for Islands in the Stream. He’s yelling nonsense syllables.
ESTJ|Regular reminder for those following along at home 
ESTJ|The Iranian people have made themselves clear They want freedom and democracy. Not dictatorship and theocracy. Join me in standing with protestors calling for freedom. Add your name to @freedomhouse’s #IranSolidarity petition

ESTJ|Every mass shooting is a tragic policy failure.
ESTJ|Protect choice everywhere. Shop our @onwardtogether collection and support our partner groups fighting for democracy and reproductive freedom. 
ESTJ|Today should have been the 50th anniversary of Roe v. Wade. We know MAGA Republicans wont stop until abortion is banned nationwide. So we cant stop fighting for reproductive freedom everywhere.
ESTJ|Democrats deliver. Heres to pushing for more progress, @joebiden and @kamalaharris! 
ESTJ|Jacinda Ardern will be remembered for guiding her country with strength, compassion, and grace through multiple historic crises, doubtless saving countless lives. Shes shown the world a new model of powerful leadership. A true stateswoman.
ESTJ|Lets keep making good trouble. #MLKDay 
ESTJ|You can save money by making your home more climate- and budget-friendly. Its all thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act that Democrats passed last year. 
ESTJ|Simply love this @GMA story following @aliceminsoochun as she brings light to children in Ukraine coping with rolling blackouts because of Putins war. Chelsea and I loved learning about her work on @solightdesign as part of @appletvpluss #Gutsy. 
ESTJ|The people of Brazil voted in a free and fair election. Their choices must be respected. I stand with them and condemn yesterdays attacks on the peaceful transition of power and the rule of law.
ESTJ|Thank you so much for your service, Debbie. Your great home state, and the whole country, are better for it.
ESTJ|Columbias commitment to educating the next generation of policy leaders—and helping to address some of the worlds most pressing challenges—resonates personally with me. Thrilled to join this community.
ESTJ|Their agenda is chaos and grandstanding. Not working for the American people.
ESTJ|Health care is a human right. And thanks to Democrats, out-of-pocket insulin costs for Americans on Medicare are now capped at $35 a month. Its life-changing, life-saving policy. 
ESTJ|Much love to our glass-ceiling-busting governor of New York!
ESTJ|Congrats to Sen. @PattyMurray, who becomes president pro tempore of the Senate today—the first woman to serve in the role. 🇺🇸 🎉

ESTJ|From our family to yours—hope you have a warm and wonderful Christmas Eve. 
ESTJ|So proud of all this community has accomplished. Take a look at @ClintonFdns 2022 wrap-up!
ESTJ|Zelensky has led his people and his country through 10 months of war with Churchillian courage and resolve. Eighty years after Churchill addressed Congress and America amid the Blitz, our message now must be the same from all quarters as it was then We are with you.
ESTJ|Because of Congresss failure to act, tens of thousands of our Afghan allies who have sought refuge in the U.S. will face deportation in 2023. Unacceptable. 
ESTJ|During his Hall of Fame acceptance speech, Franco Harris said he often thought How can I help my team? Can they count on me when it was needed? They could, and the example he set reached far beyond the football field. Thinking of his family and everyone mourning his passing.
ESTJ|I loved it, and no, I dont mind. (Hi again, Ruby.)
ESTJ|He is unfit to hold any office ever again.
ESTJ|Happy Hanukkah to everyone celebrating! 🕎 
ESTJ|Iranian women, global leaders, governments, and activists spoke—and UN member states listened. Iran’s removal from the Commission on the Status of Women is a victory for the work of this important body and a victory in the fight for human rights. 
ESTJ|Youre never too young to change the world. You just have to get started. If you’re a college student with a good idea and a desire to make a difference, apply to join us at @CGIU before this Friday, December 16. 
ESTJ|Women’s rights and human rights are one and the same. Thank you to everyone who joined us at #WomensVoices and shared what keeps them focused on the fight. You can view a few highlights here 
ESTJ|As nights get colder, millions of Ukrainians are without power because of missile and drone attacks. They could use our help to stop the drones that Russia gets from Iran. This simple initiative from historian @timothydsnyder makes it easy to lend a hand. 
ESTJ|Would we call that singing, or more like enthusiastically shouting along? Either way, it was a lot of fun. 🎶🚗
ESTJ|I could say the same about you! The Job Protection Act and the Momnibus bill to protect maternal health are exciting, much-needed vehicles of change for families in this country. Onward.
ESTJ|@cher So sorry for your loss, my friend. Sending you all the 💚 in the world.
ESTJ|.@TrevorNoah, this is a ta ta for now, not a farewell, because I look forward to laughing along with whatever you choose to do next. Congratulations on seven great years!

ESTJ|Georgia on my mind. Find out how to vote for @ReverendWarnock in the Senate runoff at 
ESTJ|Twenty-nine years ago today, @BillClinton signed the Brady Bill to help reduce gun violence. Here, watch him explain another simple way we can make progress. He knows it works because he got it done once—and we can do it again. 
ESTJ|A significant step for human rights A new presidential memorandum will ensure, for the first time, that acts of sexual violence as a weapon of war are given equal weight as other serious human rights abuses when considering sanctions. Thanks, @POTUS! 
ESTJ|The @ClintonFdn doesnt just talk the talk. They do the work of advancing women’s rights, sharpening the skills of the next generation, and strengthening our democracy. When you chip in this #GivingTuesday, the Foundation will match your gift. 
ESTJ|There is great power when women come together and demand action. I was honored yesterday to help launch Eyes on Iran–a multimedia art activation in the shadow of the United Nations to make sure the public does not forget or ignore the brutal crackdown on Iranian women , girls.

ESTJ|@BillieJeanKing Amen to that. Happy birthday, dear friend!
ESTJ|The lineup for #WomensVoices is growing. @ClintonFdn just announced new sessions on voting rights, access to reproductive health care, supporting women in our economy, and much more. RSVP to join us virtually 
ESTJ|I’m heartbroken for everyone grieving in Colorado Springs today. Its horrifying and unacceptable to see hate against LGBTQ+ people fester in our communities. We must all call it out when we see it and help stop its spread.
ESTJ|We are three people that haven’t always agreed on everything, but we’re still talking. Check out the conversation I had with @CondoleezzaRice and @jonstewart on @theproblem this week. 
ESTJ|An incredible documentary about my friend @GabbyGiffords airs on CNN tomorrow at 9pm ET. Gabby Giffords Won’t Back Down follows her journey from Congresswoman to survivor and gun safety advocate. If you think you know Gabby’s story already, you haven’t seen the half of it.
ESTJ|The best to ever do it. Thank you, Madam Speaker. 
ESTJ|Half of 18-29 year olds are concerned that birth control will be harder to access in the future, according to a new survey from @powertodecide. When we protect access, we protect choices and freedoms. #ThxBirthControl

ESTJ|To our veterans You have the thanks of a grateful nation. We so appreciate all that you—and your families—do to serve your country. 
ESTJ|.@reverendwarnock won a run-off once to determine Senate control. With our help, he can do it again.
ESTJ|I spoke to Senator-elect (!) @johnfetterman and @GiseleFetterman last year about their remarkable partnership in life and public service. Congrats to them, and to all Pennsylvanians. 
ESTJ|It turns out women enjoy having human rights, and we vote.
ESTJ|Congratulations to Gov. @KathyHochul and everyone who fought hard for our values in this election. Win or lose, fighting for what you believe in is always, always worth it. 
ESTJ|Georgia, you have a chance to protect women today. You have a chance to expand health care access for all Georgians. You have the chance to elect @staceyabrams your governor. Please go vote today, and bring a friend with you!
ESTJ|@ChelseaClinton Who knows what the future holds! But I’m so unbelievably proud of you!
ESTJ|MAGA Republicans work tirelessly to strip people of their right to abortion. Yet they also vote against sex ed, birth control, affordable child care, and paid family leave. We can’t let a few people with an extreme agenda decide what freedoms we have. 
ESTJ|Womens rights are human rights—and those rights are on the ballot today. 
ESTJ|Polls are open! Make sure to vote today, and bring a friend or two with you. 
ESTJ|Our work to drive advance women’s rights and full equality is never over. Ill see you at the Womens Voices Summit in December, @ClintonCenter.
ESTJ|Americans work hard for their Medicare and Social Security. Lets be clear about what Republicans will do if they win back power. 
ESTJ|You know, this guy has a point.
ESTJ|Abortion bans dont just affect people getting an abortion. They also create uncertainty around medical procedures relating to pregnancy. Already, women having miscarriages have not been able to access care. Vote for our freedom and our rights tomorrow. 
ESTJ|The economy has added 10.3 million jobs since January 2021. Thats the most jobs added in the first 21 months of any presidents tenure. Thanks, @JoeBiden. 
ESTJ|New York Have you voted for @KathyHochul yet? 
ESTJ|If Republicans take power, Social Security and Medicare are on the chopping block. 
ESTJ|Tonight—join us!
ESTJ|Lets be clear about the stakes of these midterm elections A national ban on abortion is on the ballot. Please share this video with anyone on the fence about voting for Democrats. 
ESTJ|In this defining moment, make your voice heard. 
ESTJ|Ela Bhatt passed away today. For 50 years, she helped women in India lift themselves out of poverty by granting them microloans. She was one of my heroes. Here’s more I wrote about Ela and her life-changing work following my last visit to her in 2018. 
ESTJ|Republicans claim you should vote for them because theyre tough on crime. But when one of their cult members commits a crime against Paul Pelosi, they couldnt care less. 
ESTJ|Theyre looking to impose one-party rule with zero accountability to voters, and theyre not being subtle about it. 
ESTJ|Ha!
ESTJ|Mylissa Farmer had to travel to Illinois for a life-saving abortion after being denied one in her home of Missouri. She talked about her ordeal in an ad for Democratic candidate for Senate @buschvalentine. Now the state is investigating her. 
ESTJ|Happy Halloween! Stay safe and have fun out there. 
ESTJ|Join me in standing in solidarity with Iranian women and girls. The oppressive Islamic Republic of Iran’s regime should not be on the UN Commission on the Status for Women. Add your voice to this open letter to demand #IRIoffCSW 
ESTJ|Inspired by true events, the new film Call Jane could hardly be more timely. It celebrates the collective power of women and the strength we can find in community—and @ElizabethBanks and Sigourney Weaver are captivating in it. Now playing in theaters. 
ESTJ|The Republican Party and its mouthpieces now regularly spread hate and deranged conspiracy theories. It is shocking, but not surprising, that violence is the result. As citizens, we must hold them accountable for their words and the actions that follow. 
ESTJ|I loved The Kite Runner by Khaled Hosseini, and the play based on it is true to the story with Amir Arison and Eric Sirakian in the lead roles along with a terrific cast. See @KiteRunnerBway before it closes Sunday on Broadway, or if it tours near you. 📷 @TriciaBaron 
ESTJ|Its #VoteEarlyDay. Wondering how you can vote early in the midterms? ✅ Head to ✅ Find out when and where you can vote today ✅ Go cast your ballot!
ESTJ|The GOP plan for the economy has 5 parts 1) Drive up inflation , the deficit by cutting taxes for the rich. 2) Raise Rx drug costs. 3) Increase health care premiums. 4) Cut Medicare , Social Security benefits. 5) Cancel student loan forgiveness. Not convinced? Vote Democrat.
ESTJ|The suffragists paved the way for the strides women have made over the last century. Theirs is one of the most important stories in our nation’s journey toward a more perfect union. Honor their legacy by supporting the @WomensMonument. 
ESTJ|Every voter should see this clip of Mehmet Oz, the Republican candidate for Senate in Pennsylvania, claiming that abortion should be a decision between women, doctors, and local political leaders. Your body. Their choice.

ESTJ|Happy birthday Madam Vice President @kamalaharris! 
ESTJ|The reality is women are now one election away from losing our rights. In every single election. No matter where we live. #yesonprop1 
ESTJ|No matter where a person lives or how much money they have, women—not politicians—should be able to make decisions about their own lives. That includes abortion care and miscarriage management. Californians should vote YES on Prop. 1 to protect fundamental rights. #yesonprop1 
ESTJ|New York For our rights, for our families, and for our great states future, vote Hochul for Governor.

ESTJ|Carlotta Walls LaNier and Minnijean Brown Trickey are two of the Little Rock Nine—the first Black students to desegregate Central High. They had to walk through threatening crowds simply to get an education. They are a testament to the power of young people to ignite change. 
ESTJ|.@canopynwa became part of a national effort to resettle more than 75,000 Afghans who sought refuge when the Taliban took over last year. In one month, they welcomed 56 new neighbors into 13 homes in Northwest Arkansas. 
ESTJ|Of all the trips we took to film Gutsy for @AppleTVPlus, one of the most meaningful was the trip back home to Arkansas. We traveled to the house we first lived in there and talked to women from around the state who took leaps to leave behind the familiar. 
ESTJ|47 years! Happy anniversary, @billclinton. Photo The Clinton Foundation

ESTJ|Born to immigrant parents, Giselle Carrillo was taught at a young age that the ocean was dangerous. Her determination to conquer her fear led her to learn to surf. She started Los Courage Camps to encourage the next generation of girls to find their passion too.

ESTJ|Judge Abby Abinanti sat on the bench in San Francisco before pioneering a tribal justice system back home based on the values and culture of @TheYurokTribe. She established her tribes Wellness Court to focus on repairing communities, not punishing people. 
ESTJ|Growing up, @KimKardashian studied her father’s law books. While attending a clemency meeting at the White House, she decided to make a childhood dream a reality and become a lawyer. Now she champions criminal justice reform and uses her platform to fight for clemency. 
ESTJ|.@msbkb sees the justice system from two angles as a lawyer arguing for clemency for the unjustly sentenced , as the daughter of a formerly incarcerated mother. She created @gemamplifyher to empower women in prison , their daughters to break the cycle , lead lives with vision. 
ESTJ|Katrina Brownlee’s abusive ex-fiancé almost killed her. She survived and sought healing and justice by creating Young Ladies of Our Future. A mentorship program for young, at-risk women, it focuses on self-esteem, self-awareness, and anti-violence. 
ESTJ|While starring on @lawandordertv, @Mariska heard from thousands of survivors of sexual assault, domestic violence and child abuse. She realized that having someone bear witness to your story is the start of justice. Its why she founded @TheJHF. 
ESTJ|.@chelseaclinton and I took a self-defense class, told stories at @TheMoth, worked wood at @Refoundry, and learned how to make acorn soup—all with women fighting for justice. Watch Gutsy on @AppleTVPlus now. 
ESTJ|Young women, we need you in the arena. @OnwardTogether partners and allies like @runforsomething, @latinovictoryus, @collectivepac, @arenasummit, and @emergeamerica will help. 
ESTJ|Please read this important piece from @linmanuel and @vegalteno on how we can each help Puerto Rico now. 
ESTJ|Just saying.
ESTJ|A world where women were equal in every aspect of society would be richer, safer, and more stable. This summer, I joined a group of women with @GIWPS , @RockefellerFdn to discuss how to advance womens leadership. The key takeaway? We are #Overdue4Equity. 
ESTJ|@JasonKander @dianakander Sending you both love and light!
ESTJ|Iranians are protesting for their basic human rights in the aftermath of the horrific death of Mahsa Zhina Amini. Iranians deserve to live free from violence and intimidation. The world is watching.

ESTJ|One of my heroes. Si se puede!

ESTJ|Some politicians dont realize that women are the most powerful voting bloc in this country. This November, well prove it. Join me, @supermajority, and @argent today in checking your voter registration status. #VotingSuitsYou 
ESTJ|It was a joy to sit down with @Malala at #CGI2022 for an essential discussion on expanding education. Im grateful her voice is shaping the conversation and inspiring girls to make themselves heard worldwide.
ESTJ|When they said Lock her up, it wasnt just about me. You can see it in the abortion bans spreading through the country. Lady Justice by @DahliaLithwick, out today, unpacks the magnitude of our struggle and how we can fight back through the law. 
ESTJ|In just a few minutes, Im joining @melindagates and @agnesbinagwaho to explore how a new wave of female leadership is poised to fight for human rights. I hope youll tune in 
ESTJ|We are facing a critical moment for reproductive and maternal health. We need global leadership to meet it. Thank you to @SecBecerra, @MEtiebetMD, @CTurlington, @Atayeshe, @hegdeaparna, @HelenClarkNZ, and @MollyJongFast for joining me to discuss solutions at #CGI2022.
ESTJ|.@ClintonGlobal is about commitment. Looking forward to seeing this community back together again. If you can’t join us in NYC today, I hope we’ll see you online

ESTJ|Thank you, Kim. It was a pleasure talking to you about what it means to be gutsy in business, law, and life in general!

ESTJ|We had such a good time talking all things #Gutsy with @KellyClarkson. Watch
ESTJ|Excited to be on @kellyclarksontv today! Even happier that @kellyclarkson didn’t ask me to sing. 
ESTJ|See these women as you’ve never seen them before—and discover some new favorites—in Gutsy Women Have the Last Laugh, out now exclusively on @AppleTVPlus. 
ESTJ|What do you call a card shark in bowling? I call her @iamwandasykes. We should have known we were in trouble when she showed up at the alley with her own ball and shoes. When she’s not trouncing us on the lanes, Wanda calls out hypocrisy and makes honest truths hilarious. 
ESTJ|.@amyschumer has dealt with endometriosis and an extremely tough pregnancy the way she deals with everything—with comedy aplomb. She shared how she uses comedy to talk about hard things and, in talking about them, lighten the load for herself and her audiences. 
ESTJ|The first episode of our new @AppleTVPlus series, #Gutsy, is one of my favorites. We talked to women who use humor to break down barriers, inspire unity, and—of course—make people laugh. For @yamaneika, @anylaurie16, and @maysoonzayid, every joke can start a dialogue. 
ESTJ|With book banning at an all-time high, a new generation of Our Bodies, Ourselves decided to take a new approach. @ObosToday is moving from the shelves directly to the hands, phones, and computers of those who need it most. Share this resource at 
ESTJ|First things first former First Lady/Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has listened to Megan Thee Stallion‘s ultra NSFW anthem WAP. True! And it was a delight to talk with @theestallion about navigating the world as a powerful woman. 
ESTJ|Republicans arent even trying to hide it. If they re-take the House in November, they will impose a national abortion ban at 15 weeks. 
ESTJ|Last week we celebrated the premiere of #Gutsy in New York City with so many of the inspiring contributors whose stories we’re honored to share. Stream now on @AppleTVPlus. 
ESTJ|Thanks for getting the word out about #Gutsy, Laura. A book now turned @AppleTVPlus docuseries, it was a challenge to narrow down who to feature because—its true—there are just too many amazing women in the world. 
ESTJ|Thinking about the collective grief of 9/11, and now COVID-19, remember 2 Corinthians 48-9 We are hard pressed on every side, but not crushed, perplexed, but not in despair, persecuted, but not abandoned, struck down, but not destroyed. Wishing you reflection and peace today.
ESTJ|Im delighted to say that Gutsy, my new docuseries for @AppleTVPlus, is out now. Join me, @ChelseaClinton, and @HiddenLightPrd for a journey across the world to see new sides of iconic women you think you know—and meet some new heroines, too.

ESTJ|I’m more tired of talking about this than anyone, but here we are. If you’re interested in the facts, you can read more here 
ESTJ|By contrast, Trump has hundreds of documents clearly marked classified, and the investigation just started.
ESTJ|Thats right ZERO.
ESTJ|Comey admitted he was wrong after he claimed I had classified emails. Trump’s own State Department, under two different Secretaries, found I had no classified emails.
ESTJ|I can’t believe we’re still talking about this, but my emails… As Trump’s problems continue to mount, the right is trying to make this about me again. There’s even a Clinton Standard. The fact is that I had zero emails that were classified.
ESTJ|Happy Labor Day! 
ESTJ|Fifty years ago, trailblazer Maria Pepe had to sue for the right to play baseball. This weekend, more than 200 girls from 20 teams will celebrate her legacy by playing the game they love at the 4th annual @nygirlsbaseball tournament. Play ball! 
ESTJ|The speech @POTUS gave last night is one of the most important Ive seen a president give. We must name the threat our democracy faces–including a MAGA faction that incites violent insurrections and rejects the rule of law—in order to overcome it together.

ESTJ|Freedom is never really won, Coretta Scott King said. You earn it and win it in every generation. On this anniversary of the March on Washington, we still need to fight for voting rights and more. Check your voter registration today. 
ESTJ|I have such fond memories of Chef Mesnier. He loved making people smile with his beautiful creations, including his famous gingerbread houses at Christmas. He will be missed!

ESTJ|Congratulations to @eileenfisherny, who hands over the reins of her iconic company after changing how an industry thinks about sustainability and so much more. Shes set an example for women and men who want it all—successful brands and social impact. 
ESTJ|Im horrified by the cowardly attack on Salman Rushdie and praying for his speedy recovery. As he once wrote A poets work is to name the unnamable, to point at frauds, to take sides, start arguments, shape the world, and stop it from going to sleep.
ESTJ|Its a great day to be a Democrat, and its a great day to be an American. 
ESTJ|I’ve seen how important it is to bring diverse voices together if you want to make real and lasting change. This year’s @ClintonGlobal speakers and attendees exemplify what it means to get things done. I hope you’ll join us this September.
ESTJ|Its a big deal.
ESTJ|My friend @davidpepper has been called one of the best political-thriller writers on the scene. Bill and I both devour his books. Davids latest, A Simple Choice, is out now. You can get it now wherever you get your books 
ESTJ|Hats are available for pre-order again. Crisis averted. 
ESTJ|That was fast—Im told hats are now sold out. Well re-stock ASAP. In the meantime, know that weve got shirts, too. 
ESTJ|Every But her emails hat or shirt sold helps @onwardtogether partners defend democracy, build a progressive bench, and fight for our values. Just saying! 
ESTJ|The women who demanded the vote changed the world. This powerful exhibition at the @ClintonCenter, opening September 10, is a tribute to their courage.
ESTJ|Dont let them get away with this. 
ESTJ|Heres what the Inflation Reduction Act will mean for you ✅Lower prescription drug prices ✅Lower health insurance costs ✅Cheaper, cleaner energy ✅A fighting chance for our planet 
ESTJ|Vote them out.
ESTJ|The Inflation Reduction Act will make millions of peoples lives better, lowering health care costs , investing in clean energy for the most significant congressional action on climate change—ever. Everyone who organized , voted in 2020 played a part in this achievement. Bravo.
ESTJ|528,000 jobs in July and a 3.5% unemployment rate. A historic deal to reduce inflation, invest in health care, and tackle climate change with clean energy. The fastest decline in gas prices weve seen in a decade. Thanks, Biden.
ESTJ|Abortion rights are crucial. Abortion rights are popular. Abortion rights are a winning issue. 
ESTJ|A victory for veterans, their families, and common decency.
ESTJ|Action is on the agenda for this year’s @ClintonGlobal—for climate, economic inclusion, reproductive health and equity, and so much more. Join us this September.
ESTJ|Veterans exposed to toxins through their service deserve care for the effects of those toxins. How is this even a question? 
ESTJ|If you can see it, you can be it, the saying goes. Nichelle Nichols gave millions of people the opportunity to see themselves on the frontiers of science and exploration, boldly expanding human understanding. She inspired so many of us to reach for the stars. What a legacy. 
ESTJ|.@GovAndyBeshear has set up a relief fund for the communities hardest hit by this crisis. If you can help, donate here 
ESTJ|The stories coming out of eastern Kentuckys floods are just devastating. Twenty-six people have lost their lives, with more missing. Whole houses, even a church, have been swept away. 
ESTJ|Its all too true, and its shameful.
ESTJ|And then share it with a friend in Ohio!
ESTJ|Im proud to endorse @karenbassla for mayor of L.A. because she’s a proven leader who will bring Angelenos together to solve problems while championing women’s rights and opportunities for young people. Sign up to help her win 
ESTJ|Well done, Olivia! 
ESTJ|This legislation would lower health care costs for families, tackle inflation, and help stop runaway climate change from threatening our kids futures. Lets get it done. 
ESTJ|Great question.
ESTJ|Many of the same Republicans who just voted against protecting birth control and celebrated when Roe was overturned also oppose paid family leave and efforts to make childcare affordable. This is not about supporting families—it’s about dragging women back in time.
ESTJ|On the move, 1992. 📸 Robert McNeely 
ESTJ|As a mother, a grandmother, and a human being, Im grateful @POTUS is using his authority to take action on climate where Congress wont. In the words of @GretaThunberg, we should be acting like our house is on fire—because it is. 
ESTJ|Climate change is an urgent threat and a defining challenge of our time—but we are not powerless. We can accelerate our transition to clean energy, reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, and call on our leaders to do everything they can to protect our planet.
ESTJ| and posing a challenge to national security. 
ESTJ|Its also hurting our economy 
ESTJ|The climate crisis is a public health crisis. 
ESTJ|There is nothing pro-life about forcing a child to give birth or preventing a doctor from caring for a woman experiencing a miscarriage. 
ESTJ|A fundamental concern for others in our individual and community lives would go a long way in making the world the better place we so passionately dreamt of. Thinking of these wise words from an extraordinary leader on #NelsonMandelaDay. 
ESTJ|I am proud to endorse @ZimmermanforNY for Congress in #NY03. Robert has a proven record of standing up to the gun lobby and protecting abortion rights. Hell defend our democracy in a key toss-up race against an extreme right-wing Republican.
ESTJ|I had a lot of fun making this with @ChelseaClinton, and we can’t wait to share it with you in September.
ESTJ|Weve got a premiere date! Gutsy, a new eight-episode documentary series from me, @ChelseaClinton, and @HiddenLightPrd will premiere on @AppleTVPlus on September 9. We cant wait to share the conversations we had with some of our favorite, fabulous, supremely gutsy women. 
ESTJ|Congratulations and welcome!
ESTJ|Mary McLeod Bethune faced segregation and threats from the KKK—but that didnt stop her from devoting her life to educating Black women and girls. Today, she becomes the first Black American in the Capitols Statuary Hall, replacing a Confederate general. 
ESTJ|If @Malala can continue to find new ways to champion women and girls everywhere, so can we all. Happy birthday to a leader who uses her voice to lift up others.
ESTJ|Trump was crystal clear about his wishes in the lead-up to January 6th. What happened that day was not an accident or a coincidence. It was organized, deliberate, and premeditated.
ESTJ|The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act signed by @POTUS is the most significant gun safety legislation in 28 years. It wouldnt have happened without the determination of survivors, advocates, family members, and public health leaders all across our country. Lets keep going.
ESTJ|@NabilahIslam @SaraJacobsCA @HaleyLive These past weeks have given us plenty of reasons to be outraged, scared, and worried about the future of our democracy. There is no better outlet than helping to elect candidates who believe Americas best days are still ahead of us.

ESTJ|@Nikki4Congress, the Labor Outreach director on my 2016 campaign and a long-time advocate for working families, is running to represent the 13th district of Illinois. 
ESTJ|For me, one of the best antidotes to feeling discouraged is supporting people who are running for office. Im so proud that Onward Together has endorsed 50 candidates and counting in 2022—including some who have worked on my campaigns over the years. 🧵
ESTJ|Not only is @JasonKanders #InvisibleStorm a great book—hes donating his royalties to a great cause. Check it out, and join Jason in supporting efforts to prevent veteran suicide and homelessness. 
ESTJ|If youve looked around and realized theres no one like you in office If youve caught yourself wondering Why isnt anyone doing something about this?! If youre fed-up and furious @amandalitman is right You should run for something. 
ESTJ|To solve the crisis of gun violence, there’s one thing we need above all else courage. No one embodies that courage more than @GabbyGiffords, and I hope her story will inspire us all to step up in this fight. She won’t back down, and neither can we.
ESTJ|Make no mistake Banning abortion puts lives at risk. Thank you, @POTUS, for taking these crucial steps to protect our most fundamental rights and access to health care.
ESTJ|The choice to become a parent should always be just that a choice. Thank you, Miss Betty, and thank you to everyone at The Pinkhouse for providing compassion and care to so many over the years. A sad week for Mississippi and our country.
ESTJ|Prime Minister Abe was a champion of democracy and a firm believer that no economy, society, or country can achieve its full potential if women are left behind. I am shocked and devastated by his assassination—a loss for Japan and our world.
ESTJ|Great to be with the First Lady of Broadway @VWOfficial and the incredible cast of @potusbway last night. Thank you for having me at your hilarious White House. Looking forward to talking all about it at @bwaycon tomorrow! 📸 @brugli 
ESTJ|If we’re serious about protecting our rights in a post-Roe America, Democrats need to be serious about investing in down-ballot candidates and year-round organizing. This is spot-on analysis from @arenasummit’s @laurenbaer.
ESTJ|Ive always known @HaleyLive to be a fighter. She ran for office to stand up to Trumps agenda, became the first woman to represent Michigans 11th District, and is committed to protecting reproductive rights. Im proud to endorse her for re-election. 
ESTJ|Congratulations to my friend @JasonKander on his magnificent new book, #InvisibleStorm. Its a page-turning, inspiring story, and I know Jason and Dianas courage and honesty will help so many. This is an indispensable read. 
ESTJ|This Independence Day, you can be the one doing the welcoming. Register to sponsor Ukrainian newcomers. @welcomeus will connect you. 
ESTJ|My friend Madeleine Albright talked often about arriving in America as a little girl—a refugee from Czechoslovakia. On a ship coming into New York Harbor, she saw the Statue of Liberty and felt like the woman was waving to her, saying You are welcome here. 
ESTJ|Sen. McMorrow is right. The fight for our democracy will be in the states this fall.
ESTJ|For anyone else who likes their beach reads to include some international intrigue—State of Terror, my thriller with mystery writer Louise Penny, is now out in paperback. Grab it for page-turning reading wherever this summer takes you. 
ESTJ|The Supreme Courts decision to hear a case next term that would give state legislatures huge power over elections is the biggest threat to our democracy since January 6. 
ESTJ|The Supreme Courts overruling of 50 years of rights was the most arrogant misreading of history and law that you could ever find.
ESTJ|The people of the Philippines deserve sources of news and information that will tell them the truth. Rappler, and Maria Ressa, tell the truth. Shutting the site down would be a grave disservice to the country and its people.
ESTJ|We must protect choice everywhere. Wear the message proudly while supporting organizations working to restore reproductive freedom in America 
ESTJ|Trump wanted an armed coup. He asked for an armed coup. And he got it.
ESTJ|We cannot let those who attacked our Capitol on January 6—and those who urged them on—to get away with impunity. Thats what happens in dictatorships and authoritarian regimes.
ESTJ|.@DonnaFEdwards is a progressive whose tenacious approach to governing has made so many lives better—in Maryland and beyond. Her voice is sorely missed on Capitol Hill. Let’s help get her there. 
ESTJ|The right wings ultimate goal is to erase the progress women have made over the last 150 years. It has never been more important to use your voice to advocate for civil rights and democracy.
ESTJ|We need more champions in Congress to help prevent gun violence and save lives. @JaredEMoskowitz will be one of those champions.
ESTJ|It shouldnt be harder to obtain an abortion than an AR-15.
ESTJ|In the last 72 hours, weve raised $135,000 to support @NARAL, @EMILYSList, and @PPacts work to protect reproductive freedom. Thank you. Lets keep going.
ESTJ|Join me today in re-committing to help people access the care they need—and win elections at every level—to protect reproductive freedom for everyone in America. 
ESTJ|Most Americans believe the decision to have a child is one of the most sacred decisions there is, and that such decisions should remain between patients and their doctors. Today’s Supreme Court opinion will live in infamy as a step backward for womens rights and human rights.
ESTJ|If you watch nothing else from the latest January 6th hearing, watch Republican official Rusty Bowers explain why he chose his country, his oath, and the truth over Trump.
ESTJ|This bill will save lives. Lets get it done.
ESTJ|Ill be proud to vote for Gov. @KathyHochul and Lt. Gov. @DelgadoForNY in New Yorks Democratic primary. Theyre leaders with integrity who are working hard to make our state stronger. Make sure to exercise your power as a voter! 
ESTJ|Bill is an incredible tour guide to American presidential history in the newest limited documentary series from @HISTORY. Watch the final installment at 1030pm ET/930CT this Monday, June 20. 
ESTJ|To meet the urgency of this moment, @ClintonFdn called the @ClintonGlobal community back together to make commitments to act on the world’s biggest challenges. I’m proud of this work. Take a look at our 2021 impact report, and join us for whats next 
ESTJ|Louder, for those in the back Donald Trump, his allies, and supporters are a clear and present danger to American democracy.
ESTJ|Smart and necessary.
ESTJ|A great question.
ESTJ|Thanks to Harry Lambert of the @newstatesman for a good conversation. I got blunt. 
ESTJ|This weeks @lastweektonight does a good job of explaining why weve got to bring about a reckoning for the monopolies of big tech. Plug in to this work by following @onwardtogether partner @accountabletech! 
ESTJ|The latest January 6 hearings show that Trump knew he lost the election. His own people told him hed lost the election. He then chose to wage a criminal conspiracy to overturn the results and prevent the peaceful transfer of power for the first time in American history.
ESTJ|More Americans are pro-choice than ever before. 
ESTJ|@RomeIsabelle @egalitegouv @gouvernementFR @CBeaune @MinColonna @francediploEN @USAmbFrance @PhEtienne @franceintheus @USEmbassyFrance @AurelieBonal Delighted to meet you too, and to learn about your incredible work.
ESTJ|I had the great privilege of meeting the third cohort of @SwanseaUni HRC Global Challenges Scholars last week. These young people have signed up to learn how to tackle the worlds most pressing problems. I cant wait to see what they do with their education in Wales and beyond. 
ESTJ|Its pretty simple We have a right to choose our own leaders. We cant let anyone take that right away from us. The people involved in the criminal conspiracy to overturn the will of Americas voters—which culminated in the attempted coup of January 6—must be held accountable.
ESTJ|If youd like to get a start in politics and help win the midterms for Democrats, join @gainpowerorgs virtual career fair on June 16. Register to learn about opportunities with @thedemocrats, @americavotes, and many @OnwardTogether partners. 
ESTJ|Just one great reason to watch todays January 6 hearings? Trump and the MAGA Republicans desperately dont want you to.
ESTJ|I rarely feel more full of hope than after an @onwardtogether convening. This week’s was a chance for people from our partner groups to compare notes, swap success stories , talk midterm strategy. Thank you to our partners , to everyone who supports this work every day. Onward! 
ESTJ|Congratulations to my dear friend @lottieshack, former mayor of @CityLittleRock and the longest-serving Vice Chair of @thedemocrats, for receiving the Lifetime Achievement Award at this weeks @GAINPOWERORGs #PowerfulIDEA Awards. A much-deserved recognition. 
ESTJ|We know this isnt any way to live. The only question now is what your members of Congress will do about it. Make sure they hear from you.
ESTJ|Fox News wont air the January 6 hearings because they prefer their sedition made fresh on-site.
ESTJ|@EmmaLewellBuck Thanks for joining us - lovely to meet you!
ESTJ|@DMiliband A joy to join you, my friend.
ESTJ|This weekend in mass shootings - Three people were killed and at least 14 injured in Chattanooga, Tenn. - Three people were killed and at least 11 injured in Philadelphia. We wont accept this state of affairs as a normal Saturday in America.
ESTJ|Thrilled to join @hayfestival last night in Wales to talk Putin, disinformation, and democracy while quoting my friend Madeleine Albright Im an optimist who worries a lot. Photo Billie Charity 
ESTJ|So pleased to be joining you. See you soon!
ESTJ|We are the majority. We are in the right. And we will win. #WearOrange 
ESTJ|No one actually needs an AR-15.
ESTJ|Congratulations to my friend—and @onwardtogether board member—@IAmMinyon on getting a designation shes long deserved Living Legend. Proud to work alongside you! 
ESTJ|Even before the school shooting in Uvalde, three out of five Americans said they wanted stronger gun laws. We are the majority. Dont forget it. 
ESTJ|To honor those who lost their lives fighting for this country, lets keep working toward an America of liberty and justice for all. Wishing you a Memorial Day full of reflection, gratitude, and family. 
ESTJ|.@ChefJoseAndres and @WCKitchen have spent the last several years bringing light to people suffering the darkest days of their lives. The new documentary We Feed People tells their inspiring story, and Im so looking forward to watching it on @DisneyPlus.
ESTJ|What changed in the mid-2000s to accelerate deaths from mass shootings? The assault weapons ban expired. We have the tools to prevent gun violence. We just need leaders with the conscience and courage to implement them. 
ESTJ|Its the guns. 
ESTJ|Guns have overtaken car accidents as the leading cause of death for children in the United States. 
ESTJ|A society that allows its children to be murdered at school has failed its children. But we can and must change.
ESTJ|The Senate must consider an exception to the filibuster to curb gun violence. They did it to raise the debt ceiling and confirm Supreme Court justices. They can do it to stop another 19 families from getting the unimaginable news that their child has been murdered at school.
ESTJ|Thoughts and prayers are not enough. After years of nothing else, we are becoming a nation of anguished screams. We simply need legislators willing to stop the scourge of gun violence in America that is murdering our children.
ESTJ|House GOP leaders were among the 192 Republicans who voted against providing $28 million in aid to the Food and Drug Administration to address the shortage of baby formula—within days of criticizing President Biden for not doing enough on the issue. 
ESTJ|To all the parents scrambling for baby formula—thanks to the Biden administration and our service members, help is on the way.
ESTJ|Please listen to @RepLucyMcBath as she speaks for so many women who have had miscarriages and stillbirths—tragic losses the right wing seeks to criminalize.
ESTJ|@BahatiRemmy @Columbia @columbiajourn We are READY. Congratulations again!
ESTJ|Ask your Republican member why they voted no on helping to end the baby formula shortage, which is hurting already-born babies. Better yet, remember their hypocrisy in November.
ESTJ|You havent lived until youve had 10,000 young people yelling Speech! Speech! at you. Love you, @Columbia, and congrats again, class of 2022!
ESTJ|Congratulations to the newest Democratic nominee to represent Pennsylvania in the Senate, @JohnFetterman. I spoke to John and his wife @GiseleFetterman about their fight for working families, and their partnership, on my podcast last year. Listen here 
ESTJ|Im thrilled to be joining the celebration of @Columbias 2022 graduates today. Follow along starting at 1015am ET 
ESTJ|Texans Are you ready to counter white supremacy, defend abortion rights, and protect trans people from attacks by right-wing state government? Register for Arena Summit in Austin by June 1 and learn how to make change. 
ESTJ|You can now order eight more at-home COVID tests for free, thanks to the Biden administration 
ESTJ|It should not be hard for elected officials and candidates to disavow paranoid white supremacist fantasy like great replacement theory. It should be a bare-minimum requirement for engagement in politics.
ESTJ|Listen for an uplifting conversation with First Lady @DrBiden about her advice for young people and how to cultivate compassion in our communities.
ESTJ|States with impending abortion restrictions should provide -Universal health care for mothers , babies -Access to contraception -Affordable child care -Paid parental leave Instead, they offer the least support to mothers and children in the country. 
ESTJ|If Republicans in Congress can issue protections for Supreme Court justices after peaceful protests, they should protect the American people from out-of-control gun violence after three mass shootings in two days.
ESTJ|The mass shooting in Buffalo is both heartbreaking and outraging. How long will we tolerate innocent lives being ended by the toxic mix of racism and guns?
ESTJ|When Alito purports to place the future of abortion in the hands of women voters, he is denying the stark political disenfranchisement of Black and Latina women that the Court itself has abetted. To which women, then, is he referring? —@SifillLDF 
ESTJ|The Republican, pro-life position is now that certain babies should starve.
ESTJ|In the days since the extreme bloc of the Supreme Court signaled theyd rip away abortion rights, even more Americans have identified themselves as pro-choice and say abortion should be legal in all or most cases. 
ESTJ|They will come next for contraception because this is fundamentally about controlling women. 
ESTJ|None of us should accept a future in which our daughters and granddaughters have fewer rights than we did.
ESTJ|Wonderful to talk with you, @MayorOfLondon, about the urgent challenges our planet faces as well as how the @ClintonGlobal community can take action.
ESTJ|Don’t feel helpless about the extreme members of the Supreme Court taking away women’s rights. Join a rally in your area this Saturday, support pro-choice candidates, speak out! #BansOffOurBodies 
ESTJ|A spot of hope from @onwardtogether partner @runforsomething. If youd like to run for office as a Democrat but dont know how to get started, they can help.
ESTJ|Welcome news Millions of low-income Americans will be able to get high-speed internet service for no more than $30 a month under an agreement the Biden administration has reached with major internet providers. 
ESTJ|The First Ladys visit to Ukraine this weekend was an important gesture of solidarity with Ukrainian families. As Putins war goes on, our hearts are with everyone separated from their loved ones and raising kids amid conflict, one day at a time.
ESTJ|I am more determined than ever to follow the example of my own mother in fighting for a country where everyone is equal and free to create the life and family they want. Happy Mothers Day. 
ESTJ|To celebrate mothers, we should ensure no mother has to watch her children grow up in poverty in the richest nation on the earth. To celebrate mothers, we should make sure no one is forced to become one against her will.
ESTJ|To celebrate mothers, we should make sure mothers and their children have health care. To celebrate mothers, we should offer paid parental leave and paid sick leave. To celebrate mothers, we should make quality child care affordable for everyone.
ESTJ|I said what I said.
ESTJ|This is about controlling women. This is about turning the clock back on half the population of our country.
ESTJ|@SenGillibrand We will. And I believe that we will win. Always such a pleasure to see you, my friend.
ESTJ|Any American who says, Im not a woman, this doesnt affect me, Im not Black, that doesnt affect me, Im not gay, that doesnt affect me Once you allow this kind of extreme power to take hold, you have no idea who they will come for next. 
ESTJ|Theres nowhere I would have rather been today than the opening of @vitalvoices Global HQ for Women’s Leadership. We must make this the moment we tip the balance back towards progress. I know this space will be a home for the ideas and leadership to drive that progress forward. 
ESTJ|Happy opening day to @vitalvoices HQ! I was so thrilled to be a part of the celebration to launch this gathering place for world-changing women. (The giant scissors were fun, too.) If youre in DC, get a feel for the new space during Saturdays open house.
ESTJ|Stereotypes that lead to violence against Asian Americans are worsening, according to new data from a @taaforg and @goLAAUNCH survey. Information like this is crucial for identifying solutions to ensure AAPIs can feel the sense of belonging they deserve in this country.
ESTJ|A new Washington Post-ABC News poll finds that 54% of Americans think Roe should be upheld while only 28% believe it should be overturned. Thats a two to one margin. 
ESTJ|@ChristyL1781 Lovely to meet (and hug) you!
ESTJ|.@TimRyan would fight for Ohios workers, and fight to protect all of our rights, in the U.S. Senate. He just won his primary. Can you pitch in today to help him in a tough race? 
ESTJ|As of today, abortion is still legal in the U.S. Please share.
ESTJ|Hats Totes 
ESTJ|New in the @onwardtogether store Protect choice. Proceeds will go to partners and allies fighting to elect pro-choice candidates and protect abortion rights everywhere. 
ESTJ|If youre in New York this afternoon, join grassroots organizers in support of abortion rights at Foley Square. 
ESTJ|Womens rights are human rights and human rights are womens rights. An extreme wing of the Supreme Court may seek to deny that fundamental truth. They may try to force their views on a country where 70% of people want Roe upheld. We will not be quiet and we will not go back.
ESTJ|Not surprising. But still outrageous. This decision is a direct assault on the dignity, rights, , lives of women, not to mention decades of settled law. It will kill and subjugate women even as a vast majority of Americans think abortion should be legal. What an utter disgrace.
ESTJ|The pain and horror of the Holocaust must never be forgotten. @HiddenLightPrd is proud to partner with director @SaraTaksler and producers @RetroReport to bring David Wisnia’s remarkable story #HowSabaKeptSinging to the screen. 
ESTJ|Wishing a joyful Eid Mubarak to everyone celebrating!
ESTJ|@Vegalteno @LinManuel @ltmphd @PublicTheaterNY @OnwardTogether @latinovictoryus @potusbway A wonderful day. Grateful to share it with you , yours!
ESTJ|@DMiliband Looking forward to it, my friend!
ESTJ|Thanks to @linmanuel, @vegalteno, and everyone who joined us yesterday for a special performance of Suffs to benefit @latinovictoryus and @onwardtogether. Telling the story of the fight for women’s suffrage, the show is inspiring and reminds us that our work is never over. 
ESTJ|Here’s an incredible opportunity to help people fleeing Ukraine @POTUS has announced a path for 100,000 people to get refuge in the US, but they need a US citizen or permanent resident to be their sponsor. That could be you. Learn more via @WelcomeUS 
ESTJ|.@Madeleine knew better than most that yes, it can happen here—and time is of the essence. We must heed the wisdom of her life and the cause of her public service and stand up to dictators and demagogues—from Ukraine to the halls of our own capital. 
ESTJ|@AllySammarco Of course you did! Lovely to meet you.
ESTJ|Marking Holocaust Days of Remembrance feels more important with every passing year. Lets remember the millions of Jewish people murdered and displaced, speak truth in the face of denial, and reaffirm our commitment to fighting hate everywhere. 
ESTJ|A former judge appointed by George H.W. Bush, who advised Pence during January 6, lays out the Republican plan to steal the 2024 election—and how to stop it. 
ESTJ|My full eulogy here 
ESTJ|I was honored to speak at @madeleine’s memorial service at the National Cathedral today. Let us honor her life and legacy by being the indispensable nation she loved and served. And let us live as she did—in a hurry to do the most good we can with every season under heaven. 
ESTJ|Come meet us in New York next month!
ESTJ|Republican state legislators and governors could be a part of the solution to stop gun violence. But theyd rather sell out childrens safety for campaign contributions from the gun lobby.
ESTJ|In her beautiful new book, Parent Nation, @DrDanaSuskind argues that Parents cannot and should not be expected to go it alone when engaged in the important work of raising children. I entirely agree. Pick up her book for a hopeful path forward! 
ESTJ|For the first time, guns became the leading cause of death in 2020 for children and teens—more than car accidents or cancer. Our kids should not pay the cost of Republican legislators refusal to pass common-sense laws that would prevent gun violence. 
ESTJ|They got it done! 
ESTJ|This Wednesday, participate in a night of incredible stories honoring the activism and humanity of AAPI women and girls.
ESTJ|Read this for a dose of hope! 
ESTJ|I always appreciated Orrin Hatch’s willingness to find common ground. When I was first lady, he worked with me and Ted Kennedy to get SCHIP done, as a fellow Senate colleague, he reached across the aisle to serve Utah and the country. Thinking of his family.
ESTJ|Im so grateful to secretaries of state around the country, like Sec. Benson, who work to ensure Americans can vote and have their voices heard. To join this important work, follow @onwardtogether partner @IVoteFund.
ESTJ|Happy Earth Day. I believe our children and grandchildren deserve to grow up on a planet thats not just livable, but thriving. We have a tremendous responsibility to deliver that future for our loved ones and every generation that follows. Today, lets recommit to achieving it.
ESTJ|For too long, tech platforms have amplified disinformation and extremism with no accountability. The EU is poised to do something about it. I urge our transatlantic allies to push the Digital Services Act across the finish line and bolster global democracy before its too late.
ESTJ|More than eight in 10 Americans dont think books depicting race, history, or ideas they disagree with should be banned. 
ESTJ|Whos afraid of Judy Blume? Right-wing censors, apparently. 
ESTJ|A lovely show of support for moms who are athletes @AllysonFelixs sneaker brand Saysh will offer a free pair to people whose shoe size changes during pregnancy. 
ESTJ|Make sure your friends and neighbors know the choice they have in November. 
ESTJ|I know that hate will only win if people like me stand by and let it happen. Please watch this incredible speech from Michigan State Senator @MalloryMcMorrow, who is not standing by. 
ESTJ|Republican officials are banning books from Toni Morrison novels to math textbooks, threatening everyones right to read and learn what they like. But we can fight back. Share this resource of free banned books with someone who needs it. 
ESTJ|Happy Easter! 
ESTJ|Setting up events for campaign and government events, known as advance work, is an incredibly important job—and its a whole lot of fun. Learn how you can get the skills you need at Advance Camp in DC on April 23rd. Apply at 
ESTJ|Wishing the Jewish community a Passover celebration this weekend full of faith and family. Chag sameach!
ESTJ|Another day, another unconstitutional abortion ban from Republican legislators. Kentuckys new law seeks to ban abortions at 15 weeks. No exceptions for rape or incest. In a 2021 Gallup poll, only 19% of respondents agreed with restrictions so extreme. 
ESTJ|My one big piece of career advice for students at #CGIU2022, and everywhere Find something you are excited about doing every single day. 
ESTJ|Im excited to speak with one of my favorite authors today, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, to help wrap up an energizing few days of #CGIU22. Join us at 115pm ET! 
ESTJ|Oklahoma Republicans just passed an unconstitutional ban on abortion. Know that Roe v. Wade is still in effect, abortion is legal in America, and we can never stop fighting for womens health and rights.
ESTJ|My heart goes out to everyone affected by yesterdays shooting on the subway in Brooklyn and by separate attacks in the Bronx. I’m grateful to the first responders and to all New Yorkers who embody the best of the city by offering help, comfort, and care to their fellow citizens.
ESTJ|I know our world will be in good hands if we give the next generation of student leaders, like those in @CGIU, the chance they deserve to make their contributions.
ESTJ|Such a joy to join @FLOTUS yesterday and talk about community colleges not just as centers of learning but spaces for connection and shared understanding. #CGIU22 continues today at 12pm ET—join us 
ESTJ|Join me and @FLOTUS today to talk about the power of community colleges, the future of the American workforce, and more. Well help kick off this weeks #CGIU22 meeting at 12pm ET, with many more speakers to come over the next few days. Follow along at 
ESTJ|Congratulations to Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, the first Black woman and first public defender on the Supreme Court. Without the commitment of voters and organizers to take back the Senate and White House, this historic moment might not have happened. Well done. Onward. 
ESTJ|Kate McKinnon and I talked about how Saturday Night Live incorporates people who are decidedly not actors into sketches—like me! Heres how I came to be Val the bartender. Hear our full conversation on this weeks You And Me Both, available wherever you get your podcasts. 
ESTJ|.@EricBoehlert’s death is terrible news. I’m devastated for his family and friends and will miss his critical work to counteract misinformation and media bias. What a loss.
ESTJ|Sums it up!
ESTJ|I loved talking to the one-of-a-kind Kate McKinnon about COVID, comedy, Carole Baskin, and how she got so good at playing me on TV. Listen to the season finale of You And Me Both wherever you get your podcasts. 
ESTJ|A sneak peek at wholl help me close out this season of my podcast, You And Me Both Its Hillary Clinton. One of them, anyway. Look out for the episode in your feeds tomorrow. 
ESTJ|Republican officials are so determined to transform voter fraud from a flimsy pretense for suppressing votes to an actual phenomenon, they keep committing it themselves. 
ESTJ|The only way were going to end the bloodshed and terror Putin has unleashed in Ukraine—and the only way were going to protect Europe and democracy—is to do everything we can to impose even greater costs on Putin. 
ESTJ|Last year, a historic number of LGBTQ people were elected to office. In 2022, we can set new records. Add to the momentum by running yourself, or by encouraging a friend to run. #OutToWin
ESTJ|Putin’s invasion of Ukraine underscores the need to fight autocracy and defend free, democratic societies. The Hungarian elections on April 3 are an opportunity to reaffirm democracy. Hungarians in Hungary, the U.S., and elsewhere Go vote!
ESTJ|The only person who gets to call me Hilly Billy is @HannahGadsby. I loved our conversation about how her life changed, and how she changed, after her breakthrough comedy special, Nanette. You can find our full conversation wherever you get your podcasts. 
ESTJ|To me, resilience of spirit (far more than brilliance of intellect) is the essential ingredient of a full life, @madeleine wrote. She would know. More of her reflections on life, and living it, are in the @washingtonpost. 
ESTJ|It feels more important than ever to mark this years Trans Day of Visibility as laws threatening trans people pass through state legislatures around the U.S. These laws represent government overreach that targets an already-vulnerable group. We must stand up for trans people. 
ESTJ|As Putin bombs civilians in Ukraine and the world condemns him as a war criminal, Trump is… once again asking him for help besting his political opponents. What is wrong with him? 
ESTJ|Now people know me, @hannahgadsby says. The room changes when I walk into it. I know the feeling! We talked about fame, comedy, healing from trauma, and her brand-new memoir on this weeks You And Me Both. Listen wherever you get your podcasts. 
ESTJ|Real news, and Im really excited! Check out the production if youre in Little Rock.
ESTJ|Petro dictators like Putin lose power when other states no longer depend on their energy supply. At State, I helped found the US-EU Energy Council to set us on that road. The current crisis is an opportunity to take more strides toward a clean energy future.
ESTJ|@lutherlowe @weijia A woman after my own taste buds.
ESTJ|I want to push the envelope as far as I can, I told @madeleine ahead of my speech in Beijing. Then do it, she said, telling me how I could sharpen my argument that women’s rights are human rights. My reflections on the life , career of my dear friend 
ESTJ|I spoke to @anneapplebaum about a lesson we should learn from Putins unprovoked attack on Ukraine we cannot take democracy for granted. Find our full conversation on this weeks You And Me Both, available wherever you get your podcasts. 
ESTJ|Amb. Michael @McFaul on Putin Hes paranoid about democracy. He should be. Listen to my full conversation with Amb. McFaul, President Obamas ambassador to Russia, on this weeks You And Me Both. 
ESTJ|A small thing, not possible until @madeleine Getting briefed on matters of state in the ladies room. Photo @BarbKinney 
ESTJ|I will always be deeply grateful for the wonderful friendship Bill and I shared with @madeleine and the unfailingly wise counsel she gave us over so many years. So many people around the world are alive and living better lives because of her service.
ESTJ|Losing your job used to mean losing your health insurance. Twelve years ago, the ACA changed that fact—and millions of Americans lives. #ThanksObamacare 
ESTJ|@jrpsaki Thank you for the tips, Jen—and hope you feel better soon!
ESTJ|Twelve years ago today, the Affordable Care Act became law—and there was a lot of hugging to celebrate. Has the ACA helped you or someone you love over the last 12 years? 
ESTJ|Bill tested negative and is feeling fine. Hes quarantining until our household is fully in the clear. Movie recommendations appreciated!
ESTJ|Well, Ive tested positive for COVID. Ive got some mild cold symptoms but am feeling fine. Im more grateful than ever for the protection vaccines can provide against serious illness. Please get vaccinated and boosted if you havent already!
ESTJ|After weeks of horror, what happens next in Russia’s unprovoked war on Ukraine? Join me as I talk to two experts—@McFaul and @AnneApplebaum—about what drives Putin, what the US can do to help Ukraine, and how to fight Russias crackdown on truth. 
ESTJ|Id say shes qualified. Source @washingtonpost 
ESTJ|Apply yourself, or share with a friend who should apply!
ESTJ|My wide-ranging conversation with @ericadamsfornyc covered his vision for New York, his long career of policing and public service, and how some incredible wisdom from his mother changed his life. Hear our full conversation on this weeks You , Me Both. 
ESTJ|The future of work is one where women have the power to construct systems that work for them, not just survive within those constructed by and for men. Im thrilled to recommend @reshmasaujanis new call to arms for equal pay, parental leave and more. 
ESTJ|Free Brittney. 
ESTJ|.@wutrain is the first woman, first Asian American, and first mother to be elected mayor of Boston. I loved this story she told me about how her kids are adapting. You can listen to our full conversation on this weeks You And Me Both. 
ESTJ|As we mark a year since the Atlanta spa shootings, Asian Americans around the country continue to experience violence and harassment. Its awful and must stop. Please look out for your neighbors and help #StopAsianHate.
ESTJ|It isnt enough to just say we support equal pay for women. We have to do everything we can to make it a reality.
ESTJ|I want to thank the Russian Academy for this Lifetime Achievement Award.
ESTJ|What’s it like running a city in this time of great upheaval—and possible transformation? I talked to two brand new mayors—@ericadamsfornyc , @wutrain—about leading their cities with vision, determination and swagger. Listen to this week’s You , Me Both. 
ESTJ|@TheRevAl @HazelNDukes So lovely to see you, and to celebrate these dear friends together!
ESTJ|As chancellor of @qubelfast, I was thrilled to present Anne Anderson with an honorary degree last week. Shes spent her career breaking glass ceilings in her home country and on the world stage, including becoming the first woman to serve as Irelands ambassador to the U.S. 
ESTJ|In the year since President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan into law, 90% of jobs lost at the start of the pandemic were recovered and the child poverty rate dropped 38%. This historic recovery was not inevitable, and it’s worth celebrating. 
ESTJ|Whats at stake on the Supreme Courts current docket? Pretty much everything, @dahlialithwick says. And the so-called #YOLO right-wing majority will not hold back. We talked about how to take action on this weeks episode of You , Me Both—take a listen. 
ESTJ|How do you diagnose the health of a democracy? You look at how its working for people at the margins, says @NAACPLDF President @sifillldf. I so appreciated our conversation about the fight for civil rights on this weeks You , Me Both. Listen wherever you get your podcasts. 
ESTJ|If Russian leadership would rather not be accused of committing war crimes, they should stop bombing hospitals.
ESTJ|Im not convinced either. This man is still the leader of the Republican Party, and most of those senators are still serving.
ESTJ|@karaswisher 👀👌
ESTJ|The Biden administration marked International Womens Day with deeds, not just words. Their 2023 budget will request $2.6 billion, double the 2022 figure, for foreign assistance programs that will promote gender equality worldwide. Bravo. 
ESTJ|Floridas Dont Say Gay bill is the latest example of the performative cruelty that defines the GOP brand today. It will only serve to hurt children and families. People who believe in freedom and equality should oppose these ugly measures at every opportunity.
ESTJ|This is the smart, strategic and, most importantly, the right thing to do for anyone who believes in freedom and democracy.
ESTJ|I agree with Bill! Ro Khanna’s new book, Dignity in a Digital Age, is a smart take on how we use technology to bring equality, not division, to communities across America. Buy it or get it from your local library.
ESTJ|An honor and a delight—thank you, @Forbes!
ESTJ|How worried should we be about the new right-wing bloc of the Supreme Court? Worried, says @dahlialithwick. But continuing to fight for civil rights, says @sifillldf, is how we save our democracy. Join me , these brilliant legal minds on You And Me Both. 
ESTJ|Thanks so much to everyone who joined us last night to kick off International Women’s Day! @teampelosi, @linahidalgotx, and @debramessing—you’re the best. To be the first to hear about future events, become a member of @onwardtogether 
ESTJ|Some timely advice for Women’s History Month
ESTJ|Last chance to join me, @teampelosi, and some special guests tonight to celebrate International Women’s Day the best way we know how By talking about how to elect more women to office. For info on how to join, become a member of @onwardtogether! 
ESTJ|The news is harrowing today. But we have the power to help Ukrainians. @barackobama has collected some good resources here Photo Gleb Garanich/Reuters 
ESTJ|Exciting news @AmySchumer and @linahidalgotx will team up with @TeamPelosi and me for a virtual conversation on the eve of International Womens Day. To get more info on joining us March 7, become a member of @onwardtogether. Don’t miss this 
ESTJ|This book is a beautiful way to share stories of persistent, gutsy women in science with children in your life.
ESTJ|Amen.
ESTJ|I am very, very grateful Joe Biden is our president in these challenging times.
ESTJ|What does it mean to get bolder as we get older? On You And Me Both this week, I talked to three of my favorite women about defying expectations and doing great things well into late life @repmaxinewaters, Sen. @maziehirono, and MP/actor Glenda Jackson. 
ESTJ|I talked to @maddow about Russia, Ukraine, and how all this might end.
ESTJ|We have to make sure that within our own country, we are calling out people giving aid and comfort to Putin and siding with autocrats against the global cause of democracy. 
ESTJ|We need a strong democracy in the US to win the global fight against autocracy. And the hard truth is that if Republicans won’t stand up to Trump, they can’t stand up to Putin or Xi. Read my new piece in @TheAtlantic on democracy’s state of emergency 
ESTJ|This is exciting. Judge Ketanji Brown Jacksons credentials are impeccable, and by all accounts she has the character , experience to serve honorably as an associate justice of the Supreme Court. Looking forward to her hearing and to seeing her confirmed. 
ESTJ|I am praying for the people of Ukraine. The world will hold Russia and Putin accountable for the human suffering and destruction this unjustified and unprovoked war will bring.
ESTJ|How did @cherylstrayed get so good at giving advice, and what can the rest of us learn from her? She shared all her tips, and deep truths, in this weeks episode of You And Me Both. Find it wherever you get your podcasts. 
ESTJ|Under the Biden administration, economic gains are making it to the typical Americans pocketbook. Thats worth celebrating. 
ESTJ|An important thread
ESTJ|.@madeleine is right Instead of paving Russia’s path to greatness, invading Ukraine would ensure Mr. Putin’s infamy by leaving his country diplomatically isolated, economically crippled and strategically vulnerable. 
ESTJ|Ive given—and gotten—a lot of advice over the years. This week on You And Me Both, I talked to two of my favorite advice-givers about their approach to dispensing wisdom about life, love, and politics @cherylstrayed and @vegalteno. 
ESTJ|Getting equal pay shouldnt require a lawsuit. But when it does, the people who fight for fairness make the world better for all of us. Go @mpinoe and team!
ESTJ|A good and great man who will be profoundly missed.
ESTJ|We will miss you.
ESTJ|Im over the moon that the characters Louise and I dreamed up will come to life on screen, and so thrilled to continue working with this wonderful group of collaborators. 
ESTJ|Across the country, local officials and civil servants do jobs crucial to the health of a democracy Make government work for the people. I talked to one of those officials—@LinaHidalgoTX of Harris County, which includes Houston—about how she does it. 
ESTJ|Isn’t it about time that the state that gave birth to the women’s suffrage movement—the state that has always been at the forefront of progress and reform—elect a woman as our governor? I think it is. @KathyHochul 
ESTJ|Flying off the shelves, but still available and funding @onwardtogether partners work to protect democracy, train progressives running for state and local office, and build a better future for our kids. 
ESTJ|Kind of gives their game away.
ESTJ|We all have an important choice to make this fall, because the GOP agenda is clear. Republicans will claim they’re on the side of family values. But they’ll do nothing for actual families—nothing on child care, nothing on paid leave. 
ESTJ|Lots of inspiring leaders speaking to the future of our state and our country today. Ill be delivering a keynote around 220pm. Join us.
ESTJ|@lucymcbath Thinking of you and Jordan today, Lucy. He would be so proud of everything youre doing to make sure no more parents suffer this pain.
ESTJ|Trump , Fox are desperately spinning up a fake scandal to distract from his real ones. So its a day that ends in Y. The more his misdeeds are exposed, the more they lie. For those interested in reality, heres a good debunking of their latest nonsense. 
ESTJ|When we cede our democracy at the local level, we cede everything. @DavidPepper has a wake-up call for Democrats, and I think everyone should hear it. Listen to our full conversation on this weeks episode of You And Me Both, available wherever you get your podcasts. 
ESTJ|Our democracy is in crisis. How do we fix it? Join me for conversations with two people doing the work at the state and local level Judge @LinaHidalgoTX and Ohio-based political strategist @DavidPepper. Hear You , Me Both wherever you get your podcasts. 
ESTJ|Happy Valentines Day! 💕 
ESTJ|Just in time for Galentines Day, and the news that Trump was flushing documents down White House toilets A limited edition hat is in the @onwardtogether store now. 
ESTJ|What are you doing International Womens Day eve? Spend it with me and @SpeakerPelosi to talk shop, compare notes, and make plans for progressive change. To get more info about our virtual conversation on March 7, become a member of @onwardtogether 
ESTJ|@PattyMurray I guess they’ve been busy with their stock price. But I know you’ll stay on them, and for that I’m grateful!
ESTJ|Legislators in at least 13 states have introduced 41 bills that would undermine our electoral process, the Brennan Center has found. 
ESTJ|Make America Have Measles Again? Good lord. 
ESTJ|Patty, Im curious—any response from Meta here?
ESTJ|Mmmhmm.
ESTJ|There was a moment in @AllysonFelixs career when she realized the power of her voice—and decided to use it. In the process, she pushed forward a necessary conversation about Black maternal health and how this country treats women athletes. 
ESTJ|Amazing things happen when women step outside the boxes the world puts them in. Olympian @AllysonFelix did it when she became an advocate for Black maternal health. And Vanessa Williams? Well, shes Vanessa Williams. Dont miss this weeks You , Me Both. 
ESTJ|Take a sip from your new mug as you read the news 
ESTJ|Legitimate political discourse? 
ESTJ|So many favorite thinkers among this group of instructors. Do take some time to learn from them on @Masterclass this month.
ESTJ|Growing up in Baltimore’s inner city, @AndreDeShields told me, We were not encouraged to think that we could have a slice of the vaunted American pie. In this week’s episode of You , Me Both, he tells the story of how he made it to Broadway and beyond. 
ESTJ|Happy new year to everyone celebrating today. May the Year of the Tiger bring you peace and prosperity. 🍊
ESTJ|Ive got two incredible voices, presences, and souls on my podcast this week. @BrandiCarlile , @AndreDeShields joined me to talk about making big dreams come true through art, hard work, , determination. I loved these conversations and hope you do too. 
ESTJ|This is the behavior of an authoritarian. And this man is the frontrunner for the 2024 Republican nomination. 
ESTJ|Great news. 
ESTJ|Republican officials wont lift a finger to save American students from being shot in their classrooms. But they will protect them from learning about the Holocaust and slavery. 
ESTJ|Georgia deserves a great leader. Georgia deserves @staceyabrams. If you can, help her campaign start off strong with a donation today!
ESTJ|Très chic!
ESTJ|Five years ago today, Trump instituted his Muslim ban, with real and awful consequences for families in America and around the world. We cannot go back to this. 
ESTJ|Thank you to Justice Breyer for 30 years of distinguished service on the bench, and for his admirable decision to retire now. We are grateful for your career dedicated to fairness and justice for all.
ESTJ|Across decades, countries, and campaigns, @HumaAbedin has helped me tell my story. Now, Im overjoyed to hear her tell the world her own. Listen to Humas extraordinary story of Both/And on the first episode of the new season of You And Me Both. 
ESTJ|A powerful piece from @CecileRichards on what may well have been the last anniversary of Roe v. Wade I underestimated the callousness of the Republican Party and its willingness to trade off the rights of women for political expediency. 
ESTJ|Big tech uses surveillance advertising to fuel their business model, keeping us in our filter bubbles and spreading misinformation as they silently profit off of our data. @onwardtogether partner @accountabletech is fighting back. Sign their petition 
ESTJ|A sneak peek at one of my guests on this season of You And Me Both—the one and only @VWOfficial! Subscribe now, wherever you listen to your podcasts, to get the first episode when it lands tomorrow. 
ESTJ|Todays the last day to apply for a @QUBelfast scholarship for Peace and Reconciliation. After receiving the award, Katie studied Global Security and Borders at Queens. Now, shes pursuing a career in public interest law. Learn more and apply here 
ESTJ|I believe a vote is a kind of sacred prayer for the world we want to live in, @SenatorWarnock said yesterday. The fight for the vote is worth fighting. This struggle did not begin with us, and we will not let it end with us. Onward.
ESTJ|Third Laws that suppress—or support—the right to vote are made in the state legislatures. Pick an organization or two electing state Democrats to support. @DLCC, @sisterdistrict, and state parties are great places to start.
ESTJ|Second, please consider running to be an election administrator. @runforsomething, an @onwardtogether partner, will help. 
ESTJ|First, adopt a U.S. Senate race in 2022. Volunteer, donate, talk to friends about Dem candidates who will fight for our democracy. Its a tremendous accomplishment that we now have 48 senators in favor of reforming the filibuster to protect voting rights. We only need two more.
ESTJ|Whats next? I think we know what John Lewis would do. He would never, ever, ever give up.
ESTJ|Win or lose, fighting for whats right is always, always, worth it. Thank you to the 48 Democratic senators who voted for civil rights and our democracy last night, to @SenSchumer for his leadership, and to @POTUS and @VP for making voting rights the priority it should be.
ESTJ|Coming next Tuesday—the next season of You And Me Both! I couldnt be happier with how it turned out, and I hope youll join me for wide-ranging conversations with some of the most fascinating people of our time. Subscribe wherever you get your podcasts. 
ESTJ|As Chancellor of @QUBelfast, I’m proud to offer an exceptional female student a scholarship to study politics, conflict transformation, or human rights. If you’d like to learn how to change our world for the better, this opportunity is for you. #LoveQUB 
ESTJ|Todays the day for every U.S. senator to choose which side of history they are on. Make sure your legislators know youd like them to choose the side thats protecting our democracy and your civil rights.
ESTJ|Lets honor Martin Luther King, Jr.s legacy by working to protect the right of every American to vote. The denial of this sacred right is a tragic betrayal of the highest mandates of our democratic tradition, he said in 1957. It was true then and its true now.
ESTJ|Please make time to organize for voting rights with @indivisibleteam and other @onwardtogether partners this weekend. We are in a critical moment.
ESTJ|Im holding the parents of little ones in my heart these days. It takes a village, and when youre forced to be that village largely on your own, it is too much. 
ESTJ|MLK Jr. said I had hoped that the white moderate would understand that law and order exist for the purpose of establishing justice, and that when they fail in this purpose they become the dangerously structured dams that block the flow of social progress. This is a subtweet.
ESTJ|In recent years, the filibuster became a routine way for the Senate minority to to block important progress on issues supported by the majority of voters, @barackobama writes. But we can’t allow it to be used to block efforts to protect our democracy. 
ESTJ|@Vegalteno @ltmphd @LinManuel @billboard @EncantoMovie The worry never stops, does it? But the pride and love dont either. Thank goodness theres so much to go around! ❤️
ESTJ|Your U.S. senators should hear from you this week—especially if you live in Arizona or West Virginia. Call them at (202) 224-3121 to demand they pass the Freedom to Vote John R. Lewis Act.
ESTJ|@TinaDuryea @OnwardTogether I hope so too. Good luck!
ESTJ|Years from now, our children and grandchildren will ask us about this moment, @VP said yesterday of the fight for voting rights. They will ask us What did we do? We cannot tell them we let a Senate rule stand in the way of our most fundamental freedom. #VotingRightsNow
ESTJ|Will we choose democracy over autocracy, light over shadow, justice over injustice? @POTUS asked in Georgia. The debate over voting rights legislation truly comes down to those choices. The Senate must act.
ESTJ|@JessLivMo @EquisResearch @stephanievalenc @carlosodio Congratulations, Jess! Excited to see all youll do next.
ESTJ|At crucial moments in history when democracy was under threat, Congress took decisive action to protect voting rights—the 15th Amendment, the 19th Amendment, the Voting Rights Act of 1965. This week is a similarly pivotal time for American democracy. 
ESTJ|@RepBarbaraLee Thank you for your leadership on this and so many other things, Rep. Lee!
ESTJ|The right to vote is the basic right without which all others are meaningless, Lyndon B. Johnson said. It gives people, people as individuals, control over their own destinies. Its time Senate Democrats adjust the rules to protect Americans right to vote.
ESTJ|We were all so lucky to share a culture with Sidney Poitier, and benefit from his hand in shaping it. 
ESTJ|2022 is a great year to pass Build Back Better, fund universal pre-K and caregiving for older Americans, expand access to health care, and take the urgent climate action we need. Let your senator know youre for it. 
ESTJ|On the anniversary of the Trump movements deadly insurrection, read @marceelias The Senate being the Senate and Republicans being Republicans, it was always going to come down to this Democrats alone need to save democracy. 
ESTJ|2022 is the first year womens faces will appear on U.S. quarters. Its about time. 
ESTJ|My heart breaks for the more than 167,000 children in the U.S. who have lost a caregiver to COVID. 
ESTJ|How can we in good conscience allow for a situation in which the Republican Party can debate and pass voter suppression laws at the State level with only a simple majority vote, but not allow the United States Senate to do the same?
ESTJ|Looking ahead to 2022. Wishing you a happy, healthy, and fabulous New Year. 
ESTJ|If you’re able to give, I hope you’ll consider supporting the life-changing work of the @ClintonFdn.
ESTJ|America and Nevada lost a great fighter for causes from health care to Dreamers, but he’d expect us all to keep up the fights he waged. Condolences to his family and his legions of friends. 
ESTJ|Merry Christmas! 🎄 
ESTJ|Wishing you a warm and wonderful Christmas Eve! Photo Bob McNeely 
ESTJ|We have to be clear-eyed about the threat to our elections and ready to protect voters rights at the ballot box next year. Becoming a local election administrator is one of the most impactful ways you can help. @runforsomething will guide you through it.
ESTJ|Great news. 
ESTJ|Had a great time talking to @FareedZakaria about current urgent matters of foreign policy, the inspiration for my debut thriller State of Terror, and more.
ESTJ|All the Republicans have is fear-mongering. They dont deliver for people. Democrats need to be known for listening to what people need—and delivering.
ESTJ|68 percent of West Virginia voters support Build Back Better. 
ESTJ|@UshmaU @nytimes Thank you for making it!
ESTJ|Protecting Americans voting rights against a rising tide of authoritarianism is just as important as raising the debt ceiling. I urge senators to extend the filibuster exception to majority votes on the Freedom to Vote Act and John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.
ESTJ|An excellent choice. 
ESTJ|Especially since his emails were about plotting a coup detat, while ours were about gefilte fish.
ESTJ|Who gets abortions in America? The data doesnt line up with the stereotypes. CDC numbers from 2019 show that 60% of people who have abortions are already mothers. Half of them have two or more children. 
ESTJ|The Big Lie is just that. 
ESTJ|Congratulations to @NYCFC for bringing home the MLS Cup! Youve made New York even prouder of you than usual. ❤️🗽
ESTJ|2024 is a make-or-break point for the continuation of American democracy. No one who believes in the power of voters to choose their leaders, and the continuance of multiracial democracy, can sit this one out. 
ESTJ|Theres still time to press your senators to pass the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act to save our democracy. Call them this morning. @IndivisibleTeam has a script for you. 
ESTJ|Five million children have been vaccinated in the U.S. without safety issues. If you get your child vaccinated now, they could have protection in time for Christmas. 
ESTJ|Thinking of everyone affected by these terrible storms. Grateful as always that @WCKitchen is on the ground, doing the most good.
ESTJ|Good reporting on the slow-motion coup the Republican Party is staging in state legislatures and offices of secretaries of state around the country. Dont let them throw out your vote. Fight back with orgs like @ivotefund and the @dlcc. 
ESTJ|A musical icon and a good man. Sending my condolences to his loved ones. 
ESTJ|Congratulations!
ESTJ|Who chooses, and who loses, when it comes to education choices? A new @GEMReport from @UNESCO underlines why we must ensure the poorest students are not priced out of a quality education. #RightTheRules 
ESTJ|It was necessary to carve out an exception to the filibuster to defend the full faith and credit of the United States. It is also necessary to carve one out for voting rights, the basis of our entire democracy.
ESTJ|To fight for my values, I’ve had to be resilient. Now, I’m sharing my journey like never before on @MasterClass. I’ll teach you how to build up your own resilience and equip you with practical skills to build a life of meaning. I hope you’ll join me. 
ESTJ|Heres whats in the Build Back Better bill - A $35 cap on insulin - Grants to finish college - A year of Medicaid coverage for new moms And a lot more. Read up, share with friends, and get your legislators on board. 
ESTJ|I’m excited to invite you to join my new @Masterclass. I’ll be teaching the skills I developed throughout my career—the challenges, the triumphs, and all the rest. I hope these lessons will help you chart your own path with passion and purpose. 
ESTJ|What can you do? Ask your representatives in Congress to pass legislation to restore the Voting Rights Act! And stay tuned for more opportunities to take action with @allontheline and @onwardtogether. Our democracy is worth fighting for.
ESTJ|Thanks to @BenAffleck, @TraceeEllisRoss, , @EricHolder for a good time talking about a serious topic—partisan gerrymandering and how to end it. As Ben said, Republicans draw skewed maps to avoid accountability. They shouldnt get to decide whose votes count and whose votes dont. 
ESTJ|After a decade and a half in power, Angela Merkel passes on the chancellorship of Germany today. She led Europe through difficult times with steadiness and bravery, and for four long years, she was the leader of the free world. Thank you, Angela. 
ESTJ|When people ask me What does feminism mean, or What does it mean to be a feminist? I say it means that you are in favor of the full and equal participation of women in political, civil, economic and cultural life. 
ESTJ|Just keep going.
ESTJ|It was my honor yesterday to present #HRCAwards to five incredible women working for womens rights and humans rights @PEspinosaC, @vanyaradzayi, @PalwashaHasan, @MarinaPisklako1, and Guo Jianmei. You give so many people so much hope and fortitude. My thanks to you , to @GIWPS. 
ESTJ|Much of the next 10 years of American politics are being written right now through partisan gerrymandering. Dont miss your chance to learn what that means for our democracy—and what to do about it—with @benaffleck, @traceeellisross, @ericholder, , me. 
ESTJ|Happening now the #HRCAwards. Join us as we honor extraordinary women who are fighting for womens rights, climate action, an end to child marriage, and more. 
ESTJ|Could you use some inspiration this Monday morning? Join me, @madeleine, and @melanneverveer today at 11am ET to honor the five trailblazing women who will receive this years @giwps Hillary Rodham Clinton awards. #HRCAwards 
ESTJ|Trumps effort to subvert our democracy is ongoing in states around the country. 
ESTJ|Thank you for sharing your story, Billie Jean.
ESTJ|Today is a good day to donate to Planned Parenthood and their Action Fund. 
ESTJ|Looking forward to celebrating these incredible women with all of you.
ESTJ|Could have been based on anyone.
ESTJ|We cannot and will not leave our granddaughters a world in which they have fewer rights and opportunities than we did.
ESTJ|From supporting recovery efforts after natural disasters to helping U.S. children get healthier meals, @ClintonFdn puts people first. This Giving Tuesday, become a part of the foundations work and double your impact at the same time 
ESTJ|Libraries are one of my very favorite things, too. Thanks for reading, Linda!
ESTJ|Breaking Voter suppression law working as intended. 
ESTJ|Wishing everyone celebrating the festival of lights the happiest of Hanukkahs. 🕎 
ESTJ|A peerless composer and lyricist, Stephen Sondheim stirred our souls, broadened our imaginations, and reminded us that no one is alone. He changed the theatre—and our culture—with his craft, his humor, and his heart. Everybody rise! 
ESTJ|Today, support organizations working to protect our democracy while getting 25% off the most popular items in the @OnwardTogether store. Its a pretty big deal. #BlackFriday 
ESTJ|Happy Thanksgiving! This one is all the more joyful for the greater opportunities to gather more safely with family and friends. Wishing you a wonderful and delicious holiday full of gratitude. 
ESTJ|@WholePlateWay Thanks, Andrea! Stay tuned.
ESTJ|That’s right.
ESTJ|Sums it up.
ESTJ|The fight to preserve our democracy is a worthy and necessary battle. We can never give up because the stakes are simply too high.
ESTJ|@BillieJeanKing Happy birthday! Wishing you another joyful trip around the sun. 🎉
ESTJ|So glad you enjoyed it, Christy! One of the most gratifying parts of seeing the book out in the world is seeing readers care about these characters as much as we do.
ESTJ|❤️❤️
ESTJ|This was such a good time. Thanks for having us, Zibby!
ESTJ|What would we say if we saw this happening in another country? 
ESTJ|Id never written fiction before. Louise had never written a thriller before. We spent a while staring at each other, stumped, on Facetime. But the story behind State of Terror came together when Louise asked a question that unlocked everything What keeps you up at night? 
ESTJ|Build Back Better is historic legislation that will - Lower the cost of child care - Make pre-K a reality for every child in America - Invest in urgent climate action - Expand Medicare - Cap seniors out-of-pocket drug spending This is what its all about.
ESTJ|Voter fraud is such a myth that its most outspoken critics have to commit the fraud themselves to find an example of it. 
ESTJ|Glad you enjoyed it, Beth. Perhaps a nap is in order for today!
ESTJ|This is exactly the rigged system, bad for voters and bad for democracy, that Ill be discussing Dec. 7 with @EricHolder, @TraceeEllisRoss, and @BenAffleck. Join us to learn more about partisan gerrymandering and how to fix it. 
ESTJ|Congratulations to @senatorleahy on his long, productive service on behalf of Vermont and America. Our country is better for your and Marcelle’s time in government, senator. Wishing you the very best (and more Batman appearances!) in your well-earned retirement.
ESTJ|.@BenAffleck, @TraceeEllisRoss, @EricHolder, me—and you? Join us on December 7 to talk about one of the most important battles to preserve our democracy—ending partisan gerrymandering—and what you can do with @allontheline and @onwardtogether to help. 
ESTJ|There certainly was a lot of giggling. So glad you enjoyed it, Carol!
ESTJ|Today, millions of families will receive their Child Tax Credit and breathe a bit easier. When Congress passes the Build Back Better Act, as they must, this investment in our kids and families will be made permanent. Make sure your representatives hear from you. 
ESTJ|Thanks, it was quite restful.
ESTJ|These particular high-stakes situations are imaginary, but they were written with love for the many women who take charge in such situations in real life.
ESTJ|.@HumaAbedin, New York Times best-seller! So thrilled so many are hearing your story directly from you. Everyone else, get this excellent book! 
ESTJ|To all who have worn the proud uniform of the United States, thank you for your service and sacrifice. Sending you gratitude and my warmest wishes this Veterans Day. Photo U.S. Air Force/Senior Airman Nichelle Anderson 
ESTJ|The one thing that irritates misogynists is that women keep going. —@BDutt speaking truths yesterday at #WEMeanBusiness21! 
ESTJ|Im looking forward to talking about the next frontiers in public health—and everything else—to close out @SwanseaUnis HRC Global Challenges Summit today. Join me for conversations with @Gavi Chair @JMDBarroso, astronaut @AstroDaveMD, and more.

ESTJ|Congratulations to Team @CityHarvest and all of today’s marathon participants! You did us all proud.
ESTJ|Another flashing red warning sign for the health of our democracy. 
ESTJ|I’m thrilled that @mintimm is taking the helm of @NARAL, whose work is instrumental to protecting abortion access. Mini built a powerful, diverse coalition of women on my 2016 campaign and I can’t wait to watch her lead at this critical time for reproductive rights.
ESTJ|Dare I predict this session will be out of this world? Join us all next week for fascinating conversations about the worlds most pressing problems—and how to solve them.
ESTJ|Win or lose, fighting for whats right is always worth it. Congratulations to @ericadamsfornyc, @wutrain, @shontelmbrown, and @aftabpureval for historic wins—and thank you to @terrymcauliffe and team for fighting hard in Virginia. Onward.
ESTJ|The in-person event at @92Y is sold out, but you can still join me and @HumaAbedin virtually this Thursday as we celebrate her new memoir, Both/And. Many have attempted to tell her story, but no one tells it better or more beautifully than Huma herself.

ESTJ|The president’s Build Back Better framework would be transformative for families and the middle class as a whole. It includes the largest investments in children and caregiving in generations. See what it could do for your family 
ESTJ|My friend @davidpepper is absolutely right. While we focus on debates in DC, gerrymandered statehouses are relentlessly undermining democracy all over. We need to go on offense for democracy everywhere, every year. Davids new book explains how. 
ESTJ|Gladys Boggs has spent nearly half a century in public service, and I am one of many Secretaries of State who owe her a debt of gratitude. Thank you, Gladys!
ESTJ|The U.S. is one of six countries currently with no national paid leave. We really have to do better here. 
ESTJ|It says not only to the world of academia that women’s history is worthy of study, but that women’s lives and thoughts have always mattered, that history includes not just the notable but also the marginalized and forgotten, and that no one can write us out of history again.
ESTJ|While the new Hillary Rodham Clinton Chair in Womens History at @UniofOxford is the first chair in women’s history in the world, I hope it will not be the last.

ESTJ|I hope you have as much fun reading State of Terror as Louise Penny and I had working on it together. Get it from your favorite bookstore or library today! 
ESTJ|The @nytimes calls State of Terror a romp! Just what we were aiming for. I hope you love it. 
ESTJ|Before Louise Penny and I collaborated on a political thriller together, we were friends first. Such a delight to talk to @CBSSunday about how our friendship spawned State of Terror, out tomorrow. 
ESTJ|Join me and Louise Penny on the State of Terror virtual tour starting next week! 
ESTJ|Im so thrilled that journalist @MariaRessa has been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. If you’re new to her work, listen to our conversation from February about how she’s taken on the Duterte regime and disinformation on Facebook—armed only with the truth. 
ESTJ|This is, frankly, pathetic. But passing President Bidens Build Back Better agenda would help close this gap. 
ESTJ|Yes! Education, and women, will prevail.
ESTJ|Ill give you a hint I think its too many hours.
ESTJ|My first foray into fiction! It was a labor of love with my friend (and favorite mystery author) Louise Penny, and I cant wait for you to read it. Pre-order State of Terror now to dive in as soon as its released next Tuesday, October 12. 
ESTJ|Im astonished that more people dont see, or cant face, Americas existential crisis.
ESTJ|Tech companies have spent years building audiences for fear, hatred, and misinformation. Why? For profit. Now were all living in the information system theyve helped create. But it doesnt have to continue. 
ESTJ|I have too many favorite #ObamaMemories to count, but this one is up there. Congratulations to @barackobama and @michelleobama for breaking ground this week on the Obama Presidential Center—a place to continue empowering the next generation of leaders with the @obamafoundation. 
ESTJ|Thanks to everyone who came out last night to talk voting rights with @tylerperry, @linmanuel, @sallyqyates, and me to benefit the voter education and mobilization work of @latinovictoryus , @onwardtogether. The right to vote is sacred, and well fight to protect it. Onward. 
ESTJ|A lawyer and a classicist walk onto a lawn
ESTJ|Im thrilled to invite you to the first @SwanseaUni Hillary Rodham Clinton Global Challenges Summit. Join us for insight on how well meet the most urgent global challenges from @FMWales, @KatrinJak, @AlexStubb, @InstituteGC, @SkyGroup, , @MaEllenSirleaf. 
ESTJ|💖👟
ESTJ|Let’s get this done.
ESTJ|Last chance to join us! Cant wait to see @tylerperry and @linmanuel tonight for a conversation about voting rights moderated by the great @sallyqyates. 
ESTJ|Every single vote can matter in close elections. And one in four eligible Americans isnt registered to vote. This #NationalVoterRegistrationDay, take a few minutes to contact four friends and make sure theyre registered. 
ESTJ|Missed you, #Tonys! Congratulations to all the nominees and winners, and to my friend @AudraEqualityMc for doing a wonderful job of hosting. 👑
ESTJ|Just call me Madam Chancellor. @qubelfast #LoveQUB Photos Andrew Towe/Queen’s University 
ESTJ|Trying on my new chancellors robes for size. They fit! So honored to be officially installed today as the first female chancellor of @qubelfast—doubtless the first of many. #LoveQUB 
ESTJ|Ill miss Sherry. He reached across the aisle, did what was right rather than what was popular in Washington, and represented his constituents desire to protect their beloved Adirondacks. A good man. 
ESTJ|Cant wait!
ESTJ|Our children and grandchildren deserve a livable future. In this #CodeRedClimate moment, urge your legislators to respond to this crisis with the urgency it merits. Ask them to support the climate investments we need in the Build Back Better Act. 
ESTJ|Thrilled to receive an honorary Doctorate of Civil Law on a beautiful day at @UniofOxford.🎓 
ESTJ|One week from today—reserve your spot! 
ESTJ|In her personal story of crisis and transformation, @slaughterAM shows us how renewal can be a process of looking backward and forward at the same time—facing our past with honesty and looking to the future with confidence and purpose. Pick up this book. 
ESTJ|Its been a bit delayed because of the pandemic. But Im honored to be formally installed as the chancellor of @QUBelfast this week. Pro tanto quid retribuamus? 
ESTJ|I have seen my friend @JustinTrudeau show leadership in the fight for accessible child care, protected reproductive rights, and ambitious climate action. I’m wishing him and our progressive Canadian neighbors the best in Mondays election.
ESTJ|I like the idea that Im playing for someone else besides myself, @billiejeanking once said. Shes done that all her life, and in her new book, All In, she tells her incredible story. Pick it up now. 
ESTJ|Have a moment to help protect Virginias Democratic majority? Write a letter (or two, or three!) before Saturday for @onwardtogether partner @swinglefts campaign with @votefwd to reach 1 million of the states voters. 
ESTJ|News! The great @sallyqyates—who knows something about defending the Constitution—will join @linmanuel, @tylerperry and me to talk about the urgent fight for voting rights. Dont wait to RSVP. 
ESTJ|Congrats, Gov. Newsom, and congrats, California!
ESTJ|Congratulations to Reta Jo Lewis on being nominated to run the Export-Import Bank. She will be a great advocate for American businesses around the world. 
ESTJ|Here’s a wonderful new way to help.
ESTJ|I highly recommend @AlecJRoss’s new book, out today. The Raging 2020s is an important investigation into how to restore the balance of power between government, citizens, and business. 
ESTJ|Californians—dont sit out todays recall election. Vote NO on Question 1 to retain Gavin Newsom as governor and prevent a dangerous Trump follower from taking leadership of your state. Make your voice heard by mail (postmarked by today) or in person. 
ESTJ|One night only Join @LinManuel, @TylerPerry, and me for a conversation about activism, art, and how to protect voting rights. See you there Sept. 29. 
ESTJ|Thanks for noticing.
ESTJ|Congratulations, @LaphonzaB. The mission of electing pro-choice, Democratic women just became more important than ever, and Im looking forward to working with you to do it.
ESTJ|Thank you for showing us how we can both remember and serve, today and every day.
ESTJ|Twenty years on. We will never forget. 
ESTJ|Im grateful to Debbie, Regina, and Jay for speaking with me for a special episode of You And Me Both. I hope youll listen as we mark a day that changed Americas story forever. 
ESTJ|And Jay Winuk, whose brother Glenn was killed on 9/11, shared how he made the 9/11 Day of Service part of his familys legacy. 
ESTJ|Firefighter Regina Wilson, who responded at the scene, told me what she learned about her community and herself as she rushed to find and save as many people as she could. 
ESTJ|Survivor Debbie St. John recounted her experience—including having the thought that the shoes she was wearing were terrible for running—and shared how she stayed strong on the long road to recovery. 
ESTJ|To mark the 20th anniversary of 9/11, I want to invite you in to three conversations I had with people whose lives changed forever that day 
ESTJ|Your donation to this @onwardtogether , @latinovictoryus event will be split between @NewGAProject, @BlackVotersMtr, @GALEOorg, and @NAPAWF, who are on the front lines every day mobilizing voters. Reserve your spot now 
ESTJ|Every inch of progress we gain starts with the right to vote. And it’s under attack. Join me, @LinManuel, , @TylerPerry Sept. 29 for a live virtual conversation in support of groups combating suppression in communities of color in Georgia and beyond. 
ESTJ|Happy Labor Day. For weekends, holidays, 40-hour weeks, workplace protections, and more, thank a labor organizer—and thank a union.
ESTJ|In our post-Roe reality, it’s more important than ever to elect state and local officials who will protect abortion access and reproductive freedom. Run for office to become one of them. @runforsomething will help. 
ESTJ|Pat Hume was a gracious, determined force behind the achievement of peace in Ireland. She and her husband John both made the world a better place and set an example for us all. Sending my condolences to her family.
ESTJ|If youre ready to restore integrity to our courts, join @OnwardTogether partner @WeDemandJustice today. Its past time to fight back. 
ESTJ|As Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in her dissent of the Texas law and her colleagues decision to allow it The Act is a breathtaking act of defiance—of the Constitution, of this Court’s precedents, and of the rights of women seeking abortions throughout Texas.
ESTJ|Under the cover of darkness, by choosing to do nothing, the Supreme Court allowed an unconstitutional abortion ban in Texas to go into effect last night. Their decision doesn’t change the fact that reproductive rights are human rights. Well fight for them. 
ESTJ|Thinking of everyone in the path, and aftermath, of Ida. Please follow the guidance of your local officials and stay safe.
ESTJ|If youve ever looked at history and wondered what you would have been doing amid its most righteous fights, the answer is whatever youre doing right now. This weekend, march on for voting rights. 
ESTJ|Racist, anti-democratic voter suppression laws are sweeping the country. Fight back by joining @OnwardTogether partners @alliance4youth, @wedemandjustice, @higherheights, @indivisibleteam, @votolatino and more this weekend to March On for Voting Rights. 
ESTJ|Kids are heading back to school over the next few weeks—and because they cant yet get vaccinated, adults around them need to step up. Ask a friend or family member to do their part to protect kids at 
ESTJ|Congratulations to @GovKathyHochul, New York’s new—and first female—governor. She’s a remarkable public servant, tough as nails, and cares deeply about the people of New York State. Excelsior! 
ESTJ|Thrilled to see one of our mightiest warriors for voting rights expand his practice. Congrats, Marc, and congrats to everyone in the new @eliaslawgroup.
ESTJ|Have any Fox viewers in your life? Make sure they know that what the network says on TV doesn’t match its stance in real life. 
ESTJ|.@lizshuler has worked her way up from union organizing to become the new president of the @AFLCIO, the first woman to serve in the role. She’ll fight for good, sustainable jobs for everyone, and I’m excited to help. Congratulations, Madam President.
ESTJ|Bills turning 75! I hope you’ll help us celebrate this milestone and the incredible work of the @ClintonFdn by signing his birthday card 
ESTJ|The women of America are worth the investment. 
ESTJ|The Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal will be a long-overdue investment in America and everyone who lives here.
ESTJ|As scary as the climate reality is, were not helpless. For our communities, our kids, and our grandkids, we cannot be hopeless. 
ESTJ|What a loss. Whether you knew Richard Trumka or not, you likely benefited from his decades of leadership and labor organizing. Sending my deepest condolences to his family. 
ESTJ|Congratulations, @ShontelMBrown, and congratulations, Ohio-11!
ESTJ|Happy birthday, my friend. 
ESTJ|The vaccines are protecting millions of people from COVID-19. Encourage a friend or family member to get vaccinated today. 
ESTJ|Send this story to someone you know who is on the fence about getting vaccinated. 
ESTJ|The fight to protect our voting rights is the fight to protect our democracy. Im proud to stand with Texas Democrats. 
ESTJ|Thinking of Senator Carl Levins family and community today. He was a good man who tirelessly stood up for regular people in the face of powerful interests. There is no better legacy for a public servant. 
ESTJ|Please hear these officers and the truths theyre telling to protect our democracy.
ESTJ|Republicans in office don’t want Americans to know what responding police officers went through when Donald Trump incited an attack on Congress. But everyone should watch this testimony. 
ESTJ|Ive had a strong sense of connection to elephants ever since I had the chance to see them in the wild on trips as first lady. Theyre sadly being killed at a staggering rate. But James A. Baker III and I believe this summer could be a turning point. 
ESTJ|Glad to see @SenDuckworth and @RepPressley propose paid leave for pregnancy loss. Families deserve time to process and grieve. 
ESTJ|We cant resign American voters to jumping over ever-higher hurdles to cast their ballots. Its time for Senate Democrats to pass the For the People Act. 
ESTJ|@LaurenAshley087 I believe in you! 🌶
ESTJ|After an incredibly difficult year, the Child Tax Credit is already making life easier for families like Maggies. Its the kind of policy we can accomplish when we organize and vote. Its worth fighting for. 
ESTJ|Every child should have the chance to live up to their God-given potential, and every family should have the means to provide that chance. The Child Tax Credit will help. 
ESTJ|The best way to honor John Lewiss legacy is to pass the For the People Act. Photo Barb Kinney 
ESTJ|Dozens of Democratic state legislators left Texas in a gutsy attempt to stop Republicans from passing a law restricting Texans right to vote. They’re defending our democracy, and they deserve our support. Pitch in what you can 
ESTJ|Today at 2pm ET—join us!
ESTJ|Starting tomorrow, nearly 90% of families will receive up to $300 a month per child thanks to the Child Tax Credit. Child poverty will be cut in half. Its a big deal. Join me, @VP, @ReverendWarnock, @SenWarren, @RevDrBarber, and more to mark the moment. 
ESTJ|An important book is out today Rachel Vogelstein and Meighan Stones Awakening #MeToo and the Global Fight for Womens Rights. When women organize, the world changes for the better. 
ESTJ|Starting this week, many American families with children will get payments of $300 a month, no strings attached. 
ESTJ|The U.S. should have universal, affordable child care. But until we do, this is an incredible display of solidarity from @allysonfelix. 
ESTJ|@JECarter4 @BillClinton @SanfordBishop @SenatorWarnock @SpeakerPelosi @AmbAndrewYoung Our honor and pleasure.
ESTJ|Such a joy to celebrate these two special people, and their incredible bond, yesterday in Georgia. Happy 75th anniversary, Jimmy and Rosalynn! 
ESTJ|Keep twirling, Zaila, and congratulations!
ESTJ|Congratulations to @ericadamsfornyc on winning the NYC mayoral primary, and to all the candidates on a hard-fought race. Two things all New Yorkers can agree on there’s no place like it on earth, and its future is worth fighting for. Here’s to working for progress together. 🗽
ESTJ|We are witnessing a concerted attempt to destabilize the democratic process and delegitimize our multi-racial democracy, and we need to fundamentally change the way we fight back against attacks on voting rights. Read my new piece for @democracydocket. 
ESTJ|We need to close the pay gap, and I love that this White House is leading by example. 
ESTJ|Ive always believed that the best way to love our country is to fight to make it fairer, more equal, and more full of opportunity for all. Together, we can do it. Happy Fourth! Photo Rick Friedman/Corbis 
ESTJ|Get those shots, folks. 
ESTJ|Happy birthday to my friend and co-author, Louise Penny. In this picture from a few years back, were celebrating Bills first thriller with James Patterson—and starting to marinate on the idea of working together on a book of our own. Wishing you joy today, Louise. 
ESTJ|There is nothing more powerful than our shared voices calling for change and our shared efforts to make that change a reality. Young activists like @JuAMartinezO are proof of that. #GenerationEquality 
ESTJ|Big strides for progress often start with conversations around a shared meal. Join AAPI chefs and activists to celebrate Asian American culture with @thespringhillco’s #RecipeForChange—out now from friends and executive producers @michellewkwan , @dchengx! 
ESTJ|The world has never needed gender equality more. It’s up to us to demand it. #GenerationEquality #ActForEqual 
ESTJ|A short list of topics discussed with Director-General @AAzoulay girls education, media freedom, and AI. Just another day in @UNESCOs portfolio of promoting peace and security through cooperation and culture. 🏛 
ESTJ|Twenty-six years after Beijing, it’s no longer enough to talk about women’s rights. We’ve got to talk about power who has it, who doesn’t, and how we confront that imbalance. See you in Paris.
ESTJ|Eight years ago today, the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act provision that required states with a history of voter suppression to get federal approval for changes to election rules. Since then, 26 states have passed discriminatory voting laws. 
ESTJ|Official co-author portrait. Cant wait for you all to read my first collaboration with my friend—and favorite mystery author—Louise Penny. 
ESTJ|Being funny is a rare skill. Being both funny and kind is rarer still. Congratulations to @conanobrien on an incredible late-night run. See you on the basketball court. 
ESTJ|Its all hands on deck to save our democracy. From @onwardtogether partner @indivisibleteam, heres how to help over the crucial next few weeks.
ESTJ|Throughout our history, millions of Americans have organized, marched, and bled for the right to vote. We wont let up until weve secured it for another generation. 
ESTJ|Today at 1 p.m. E.T. Join me as I sit down with the @nytimes and climate activists @GretaThunberg, @xiyebastida, and @Ayishas12 to talk about the ways women are leading the worlds response to pressing global issues. RSVP here 
ESTJ|.@swingleft has a plan to hold the Democratic trifecta in Virginia, protect our majorities in Congress, and strengthen democracy in states. Join our @onwardtogether partner this Thursday for a call about how you can get involved 
ESTJ|2020 only underlined how crucial it is that everyone, including kids, have access to quality health care. @ChelseaClinton and I had one of our kitchen-table conversations about what its taken to get closer to that goal—in front of a podcast mic this time. 
ESTJ|The future of our democracy is up for debate in the U.S. Senate today. Your legislators have a chance to protect your right to vote—and they must. Make sure they hear from you. 
ESTJ|If youre eligible and havent gotten vaccinated yet, its time. 
ESTJ|Great news.
ESTJ|This #WorldRefugeeDay, I’m joining @RESCUEorg to say #RefugeesAreCourageous. For artist @DialaBoursaly, courage is having the fears, having the worries, having all this trauma, but still having the energy to keep going. 
ESTJ|Thinking about my dear dad today, as I know so many of us are. Happy Fathers Day to one and all. Photo AP 
ESTJ|Happy #Juneteenth. 
ESTJ|Its a great day to sign up for Obamacare. 
ESTJ|Great news, and long overdue for our country to have a federal holiday marking the end of slavery.
ESTJ|Im proud to endorse @ShontelMBrown for Congress in the OH special election. Shontel made history as the first Black woman to chair her county Dem party, and shell work to help her state and our country recover from COVID. Join me in supporting her 
ESTJ|Putin is the great disruptor, but President Biden is the man for this moment. On @MorningJoe today, I laid out what I see as the challenges and opportunities for @POTUS at todays summit. 
ESTJ|At least 600,000 people have died of COVID-19 in the U.S. If you havent already, get your vaccination. Its a free, safe, and effective way to protect yourself and those you love. 
ESTJ|Love this Thanks to leadership from @RepBarbaraLee, the faces of Maya Angelou, Wilma Mankiller, Adelina Otero-Warren, Dr. Sally Ride, and Anna May Wong will all appear on U.S. quarters over the next few years. 
ESTJ|Louise Penny and I are sharing our writing set-ups today. Mine involves lots of Post-Its, lots of tea, and Louise on Facetime. Our book, State of Terror, comes out in October. 
ESTJ|Your right to choose your representatives is under attack. GOP-controlled legislatures in 14 states have passed 24 new laws this year that will allow them to politicize, criminalize, and interfere in election administration, according to a new report. 
ESTJ|Lights up! I loved being in Washington Heights with @vegalteno and @linmanuel last night for a screening of the wonderful @intheheights. Watch it however you can. 
ESTJ|You And Me Both won a Gracie Award from @allwomeninmedia for excellence in podcasting, alongside incredible company. 🏆 
ESTJ|Writing a book isn’t easy, especially when you’re telling your own story. It takes courage and commitment—two things Huma has in spades. Thrilled for her and can’t wait for everyone to read it.
ESTJ|This is a great start. When America is at its best, it’s a force for good in the world. 
ESTJ|Congratulations to @TerryMcAuliffe and to @HalaAyala for their wins in yesterdays gubernatorial primaries in Virginia against many worthy candidates. If elected, Ayala will become the states first female lieutenant governor and the first woman of color to serve statewide.
ESTJ|Bills new book with James Patterson is thrilling fun and perfect for summer. I hope you love it as much as I did. 
ESTJ|As @SimoneBiles said at the 2016 Olympics Im not the next Usain Bolt or Michael Phelps. Im the first Simone Biles.
ESTJ|Preserving America’s democracy shouldn’t be a partisan issue. But the fact is that Republican-led legislatures have enacted at least 22 news laws this year restricting access to voting. At least 61 more bills are moving through 18 legislatures now. 
ESTJ|Happy to do it, Peter. Youre an inspiration to me and so many others, and I cant wait for more people to hear the story of your life and transformational organizing in your own words.
ESTJ|Relief checks meaningfully helped struggling American families this spring. Your votes, and the administration they brought about, made this possible. 
ESTJ|This weekend, #wearorange. Its a way to recognize all the lives weve tragically lost to gun violence and show our commitment to saving more families from needless pain. We can and must end this uniquely American epidemic. 
ESTJ|Dr. Maya Shankar is a cognitive scientist who studies how and why we change. I first came across her work at the Obama White House, and we reconnected on her podcast @slightchangepod to talk about how Ive pushed for change in my own life. Listen 
ESTJ|The animating principle of my career has been that every child has a God-given right to fulfill their potential. Join me and @WCA4kids tonight to talk about how we can make sure kids grow up healthy, safe, , prepared—and celebrate all our progress so far. 
ESTJ|Happy birthday to our wonderful @FLOTUS, the one and only @DrBiden. Photo Jimmy May/AP 
ESTJ|Over a hundred democracy scholars warn that the survival of American democracy could depend on passing national voting rights protections over the next few months. I hope Senate Democrats will make the For the People Act law. 
ESTJ|I’m inspired by @NaomiOsaka’s courage. This is a moment for all of us—especially the press—to ask why it’s not enough to let her stellar performance on the court speak for itself.
ESTJ|This took guts. Thank you for not staying silent, Paxton. 
ESTJ|Dont mess with Texans voting rights. Were in a battle to save our democracy. Bravo to Texas Democrats who are leading the fight. 
ESTJ|On Memorial Day, we remember all those who gave the last full measure of devotion for our democracy. We can honor their legacy by defending government of the people, by the people, for the people—today and every day.
ESTJ|Get vaccinated. Then get a glass of wine with your friends. 🍷 
ESTJ|An angry mob attacked our Capitol, our lawmakers, and our election. They killed a policeman. And Republican leaders would rather we all not know more about what happened.
ESTJ|When the pandemic hit and schools closed, many working mothers had no option but to quit their jobs to fill the caregiving gap. Re-opening schools will help. Passing affordable child care and paid leave policies will too. 
ESTJ|Launching today The @onwardtogether store. Support progressive groups building a more inclusive America while shopping a collection of t-shirts, pantsuit onesies, and accessories inspired by some of my favorite moments (and ). 
ESTJ|Excited to celebrate 20 years. RSVP today, and well see you tomorrow!
ESTJ|The work continues.
ESTJ|I felt fortunate to be John Warners colleague in the Senate. He served our country with honor for 45 years, seeking always to do what was right for his state and for all Americans. Sending my condolences to his family.
ESTJ|Yes you can, @simonebiles.
ESTJ|Pretty much exactly what happened.
ESTJ|I was honored to help celebrate graduates of @FordhamLawNYC at this weekends commencement. As I told these new lawyers theyre graduating in a moment when the world, not just the legal profession, has never needed them more. 
ESTJ|A peek at how Louise Penny and I collaborated across many miles and amid a pandemic on our new book, State of Terror. The key Line edits—and lots of hand gestures—over Facetime. You can pre-order here! 
ESTJ|We can break down one of the barriers to more women running for office by implementing clear, consistent rules for how candidates can use campaign funds to cover child care. 
ESTJ|@SimuLiu @lisaling @RichardRVerma To me you seemed both informed AND funny. A pleasure.
ESTJ|Makes you think.
ESTJ|It’s worth reading this letter from members of the Capitol Police in full. They deserve answers on the events of January 6. The American people do, too.
ESTJ|AAPIs are the fastest-growing electorate in the country. Im looking forward to joining @LisaLing, @RichardRVerma, and real-life Marvel superhero @SimuLiu tonight for a conversation about making AAPI voices heard in elections. Join us! 
ESTJ|Looking forward to this. Join us tonight!
ESTJ|The work of protecting Americans voting rights is more important than ever. Im grateful to @LWV for helping voters access ballots and advocating for the safeguards we need to protect our democracy. Onward.
ESTJ|Its pretty simple Get vaccinated. Get your life back. 1-800-232-0233
ESTJ|This Wednesday—join us!
ESTJ|I always enjoy talking about the big issues facing the nation and the world with my fellow former secretaries of state. To mark @CAREs 75th anniversary, @JohnKerry, @Madeleine, and I had our first public appearance together in several years. Watch here 
ESTJ|Join us!
ESTJ|Congratulations, Stacey! Cant wait to read it.
ESTJ|@amyklobuchar So sorry for your loss, Amy. Holding you and your family in my heart today.
ESTJ|Bizarre, shameful, and untrue. 
ESTJ|Thoughts and prayers. 
ESTJ|Given a choice between defending American democracy and abandoning all reality and principle for Donald Trump, the GOP has once again chosen Donald Trump. 
ESTJ|Our kids shouldnt have to live—and die—like this. 
ESTJ|Voters saved our democracy from going over a cliff last November. Without action from Democratic senators, I fear we will sleepwalk right back to the edge. 
ESTJ|Some new details out today about my first novel, an international thriller co-authored with the great Louise Penny. The story starts when a young foreign service officer receives an anonymous message she realizes too late is a coded warning. 
ESTJ|Give the moms in your life a gift theyll treasure forever. Ask your legislators to pass the American Families Plan. 
ESTJ|We know waiving vaccine patents can save lives without stifling pharmaceutical companies creativity. @billclinton helped get it done for HIV-AIDS drugs in the early 2000s. The challenge with COVID vaccines now is how to deliver more shots to more people. 
ESTJ|Millions of Americans have said that health concerns and child care responsibilities—with many schools and day care centers not back to normal operations—have prevented them from returning to work. 
ESTJ|The warning lights for democracy in Florida are red, flashing, and on fire.
ESTJ|I hope everyone takes note of this announcement and feels proud of what American leadership can mean for the world when America leads with our common humanity in mind.
ESTJ|We cant talk about declining American birth rates without discussing the persistent problem of working women shouldering more than their fair share of child care. @KatieCouric and I talked about solutions on her excellent podcast, #NextQuestion. 
ESTJ|I spoke to the @guardian about the global reckoning we need on disinformation and the importance of a free press (along with the perils of persistent both-sidesism that we need to address). 
ESTJ|Democracies cant thrive when citizens cant agree on whats true. And tech companies have made algorithm-driven conspiracy rabbit holes a feature of our information ecosystem. There needs to be a reckoning. 
ESTJ|To close out this season of You And Me Both, a special guest—the one and only @JKCorden—joined me to answer listener questions. We talked about everything from bringing back Broadway to building up to two-minute planks. Dont miss it. 
ESTJ|It turns out that the people like the For The People Act. 
ESTJ|The GOPs alternate reality is a threat to our democracy. 
ESTJ|Less than 0.5% of giving from foundations goes to AAPI causes. The newly launched Asian American Foundation has quite literally changed that overnight. Congrats to @taaforg and thanks for all you will do.
ESTJ|In a world without caste, being male or female, light or dark, immigrant or native-born would have no bearing on what anyone was perceived as being capable of. A world without caste would set everyone free. —@isabelwilkerson 
ESTJ|Every mom I know is just about done, @reshmasaujani told me. We talked about why the pandemic could change the way the world thinks about moms and motherhood. Hear the full conversation on this weeks episode of You And Me Both. 
ESTJ|I can’t think of a more meaningful way to honor the actions of so many who came before us than by registering to vote. You can check your registration status at #Juneteenth 
ESTJ|Juneteenth is a celebration of freedom—a chance to pay tribute to countless advocates, activists, and changemakers and the work they did to build a more perfect Union.
ESTJ|Happy Father’s Day to all of the amazing dads out there — and to this guy in particular. @BarackObama, thank you for being such a loving, caring, and attentive dad to our two beautiful girls. We love you so much! 💕 
ESTJ|Ahead of #FathersDay, I’m moved by this story from Dechhen about her dad’s work to educate girls through The Small World—an organization in Nepal that is part of the @GirlsAlliance. I hope you’ll support organizations like this all around the world 
ESTJ|Happy birthday to my baby girl! Sasha, you bring so much light and joy to our lives—always have, always will. I’m so excited to see what this new year will bring you. Love you so much! 💕 
ESTJ|Our service members and their families give so much for our country every single day. When I was First Lady, I was so proud to work closely with Dr. Biden to honor their remarkable service. It means so much that @FLOTUS and @POTUS are carrying forward the work of Joining Forces with an executive order that helps military spouses, caregivers, and survivors get hired, stay hired, find childcare, and so much more. Because supporting our troops isn’t just about words. It’s about deeds. It’s about making sure that they and their families are able to feel the love and support of our country in real, concrete ways. That’s how we truly show them how much we appreciate everything they do.
ESTJ|I’m excited to share that Madison Corzine is the first-ever recipient of the Michelle Obama Award for Memoir! Madison is a recent graduate from Timber Creek High School in Fort Worth, Texas. In the fall, she will be attending @SpelmanCollege, where she plans to study English and Political Science in hopes of becoming a civil rights attorney. It’s not easy to be vulnerable about your life and open with the world. That’s why I was so moved by Madison’s fearless writing. I’m so proud of her and can’t wait to see all that she accomplishes while at Spelman this fall.
ESTJ|To those who haven’t had the chance to listen yet, I’m excited to announce that all episodes of The Light Podcast are now available wherever you listen to your podcasts. Let me know what you think of it when you finish!
ESTJ|@HGMedia To those of you who have listened to The Light Podcast, I just wanted to say thank you. It has meant so much to hear your reflections—and I hope you found these conversations to be useful for your own life.
ESTJ|When I sat down to write #TheLightWeCarry, my hope was this book would provide readers with the tools, practices, and attitudes that will help them on their own journeys. And these were exactly the kind of conversations I loved sharing on The Light Podcast with some of my closest friends.
ESTJ|Happy birthday, Jill! We are all so lucky to have such a kind and thoughtful @FLOTUS like you leading the way. So grateful for your friendship, and wishing you a wonderful birthday! 💕 
ESTJ|I wanted to congratulate the students in the Class of 2023 who joined My School Votes during their time in high school! These young leaders spent the last few years registering their classmates to vote, educating them about the issues on their ballot, and ensuring their peers will make their voices heard at the polls. Im so proud of everything theyve done and can’t wait to see where they shine their light next. 🎓🎉
ESTJ|I know I’m not the only one who has reflections about graduation. So if anyone else has any advice to share with the Class of 2023, reply to this tweet! 🎓
ESTJ|As you get ready to start the next chapter of your life, I wanted to share a few nuggets of wisdom from my own journey—I actually wrote about some of this in The Light We Carry, too. 
ESTJ|Class of 2023—you did it! 🎉👏🏾 You worked hard, persevered, and finally made it to your graduation day. I am so proud of you and everything it took to bring you to this moment.
ESTJ|Through @WhenWeAllVotes My School Votes, high school junior Imani Johnson found her passion for helping her peers discover the power in their vote and their voice. Read her story in @TeenVogue 
ESTJ|For 17 years, @RachaelRay has brought so much warmth and joy to people’s homes through the @RachaelRayShow. I’m so thankful for all the memories we’ve made together. Good luck with the journey ahead. I know the next chapter will be just as big as the last! ✨
ESTJ|I hope you’ll watch Working What We Do All Day—our latest documentary series from @HGMedia streaming now on Netflix. In this series, Barack sits down with people working across industries to understand their jobs, their connection to work, and explore what motivates them. 
ESTJ|Happy Mother’s Day! 💕 Being a mom to Malia and Sasha has been the greatest gift of my life, and I am forever grateful to my mom for teaching me the importance of courage, empathy, and hard work—lessons that I’ve passed down to my own girls. To all the moms out there, I hope you continue to kindle and nurture your bright light. Have a wonderful day.
ESTJ|Ahead of #MothersDay, I wanted to share her story as a powerful example of how a mother’s voice can create change. I hope youll join us in supporting young women around the world like Whitney through the @GirlsAlliance. 
ESTJ|Meet Whitney—a member of the @GirlsAlliance from Kenya. Her mother didn’t have the opportunity to finish school, but she ensured that things would be different for her daughter. 
ESTJ|Congratulations to the graduating class of @Columbia and @UChicago #ObamaScholars! 🎉 Im so excited to see the impact you’ll continue to make in the years to come. 
ESTJ|Child marriage is one of the greatest threats to girls education and empowerment worldwide—and an important new report from @UNICEF shows the challenges that remain to ending this practice. I hope you’ll take the time to read it 
ESTJ|Share your plans using #CollegeSigningDay and tag me and @BetterMakeRoom in your posts!
ESTJ|Happy #CollegeSigningDay! 🎓🎉 Whether you’re going to community college, a university, enlisting in the military, or earning a certificate, I want you to know that I’m so proud of you.

ESTJ|Thank you to all the folks who joined the @ObamaFoundations Earth Day event in Chicago. 💚
ESTJ|On #EarthDay, I’m celebrating young people who are protecting our planet—like Margaret and Raina, students from the @GirlsAlliance in Kenya who created a water purifier to desalinate water in their village and were awarded the Young Scientists Kenya Award! Im so proud of them. 
ESTJ|Happy birthday to my mom’s favorite child—my big brother @CraigMalRob. We’ve laughed together, we’ve cried together, and weve been there for one another for everything in between. I’m just so lucky to have you in my life. Love you, Craig!

ESTJ|Spending time at a local indie bookstore ✅ Surprising unexpecting fans with @JimmyFallon ✅ Seeing the looks on their faces ✅ That’s a wrap. Thank you, @FallonTonight!
ESTJ|In the latest episode of #TheLightPodcast from @HGMedia, I talk with @ProfessorEA about the importance of friendship. Weve known each other for thirty years, and shes always been an authentic and genuine friend to me. Listen now on @Audiblecom ✨ 
ESTJ|Thank you for sharing this with me, Maïmouna. There is something so special about crafting something with your own two hands and being able to pass it down to your little one must make it even sweeter. ❤️
ESTJ|Pam, I love how thoughtful your twiddle mitts are. The inclusive nature of the knitting community has a special way of bringing people together. Thank you for sharing your talents with me! 🧶
ESTJ|So cute! Thanks for sharing this with me, Aylin. 💕
ESTJ|You nailed it! Absolutely love this, Jenny. ❤️

ESTJ|.@DrMayaAngelou was one of my heroes. A woman of many talents, her greatest gift was the ability to see people—sometimes in ways no one else had. On what would have been her 95th birthday, let’s strive to embody the wisdom, generosity, and love she showed the world every day. 
ESTJ|Knitting has truly become one of my favorite pastimes, and I’ve enjoyed the feeling of slowing down and creating something from hand. I know so many of you are knitters – I’d love to see something you’ve proudly made and hear why you enjoy knitting so much. Use #TheLightWeCarry! 
ESTJ|In knitting, when you create the first stitch of a new project, you cast on. When an item is finished, you bind off. Both of these actions, Ive found, are incredibly satisfying bookends of something manageable and finite. #TheLightWeCarry 🧶 
ESTJ|I just love this story about two high school students, Calcea Johnson and NeKiya Jackson, who are on the cusp of an incredible mathematical discovery. Way to go, NeKiya and Calcea! Im rooting for you and cant wait to see what you all do next. 👏🏾

ESTJ|For more than 26 years, @Oprah has been celebrating the magic of books and has built an amazing community of readers—and I’m lucky my own memoir is a part of it! Oprah, congratulations on your 100th book selection, Hello Beautiful by Ann Napolitano! I can’t wait to read it. 📚

ESTJ|My heart goes out to these girls in Iran. They should be learning in their classrooms today—instead, many are sick in the hospital. No girl should ever be afraid to go school, and weve got to do what we can to stand up for them and for girls everywhere.
ESTJ|You can take action today to support girls through the @GirlsAlliance Fund 
ESTJ|This #InternationalWomensDay, I hope you’ll read my piece with Amal Clooney and @MelindaGates in @TIME about how we’re working together to help end child marriage—one of the greatest barriers to girls’ education and empowerment worldwide. 
ESTJ|I had so much fun talking to my good friend @HodaKotb for the first episode of The Light Podcast, from @HGMedia. We talked about parenting, overcoming self-doubt, and the importance of finding your light. Listen now on @Audiblecom #TheLightxAudible

ESTJ|I couldn’t be more grateful for the work that our nation’s school counselors do every day for our students. Congratulations to Meredith Draughn, an elementary school counselor in North Carolina, who is the 2023 @ASCA School Counselor of the Year! #ReachHigher 
ESTJ|One of my readers, Deborah, wrote a thoughtful reflection about her grandfather after she finished #TheLightWeCarry. Deborah, it means so much to know that the stories of my grandfathers, Southside and Dandy—moved you in this way. Thank you for sharing. 
ESTJ|Happy Valentine’s Day, @BarackObama! I couldn’t have asked for a better partner to navigate life with. Love you! 💘 Photo credit Amos Jackson III 
ESTJ|Happy International Day of Women and Girls in Science! I’m so proud to celebrate women around the world who are breaking barriers in #STEM – including Betty, a member of the @girlsalliance from Kenya who gives girls with disabilities access to #STEM education. Watch her story 
ESTJ|Congratulations @Beyonce for making history. Thank you for blessing us all with the music we live our lives to—the songs that keep us singing and dancing and talking. You deserve all this and more! 💕👑

ESTJ|I’m thrilled to share that my new @HGMedia podcast, The Light, will be available on @audiblecom on March 7! I cant wait for you to hear some of the stories and conversations I’ve been having with some of my close friends about so many of the issues we’re all navigating. 
ESTJ|Id love to hear from you. Whats a practice or purpose that lifts you up? #TheLightWeCarry
ESTJ|For me, the practice I’ve had—and the effort I make—in finding and appreciating the light inside of other people has become one of my most valuable tools for overcoming uncertainty and keeping my hopefulness intact. #TheLightWeCarry
ESTJ|In my book #TheLightWeCarry, I share some of the tools and practices that have helped me along my journey. I recently had some friends share what uplifts them. Here are their reflections! 
ESTJ|Today, we honor Hadiya Pendleton—a beautiful life lost to the tragedy of gun violence ten years ago today. Barack and I hope that, through the Hadiya Pendleton Winter Garden at the Obama Presidential Center, we can honor her legacy and inspire others. 
ESTJ|Barack, @BChesky, and I can’t wait to welcome a new class of Voyagers! Applications are now open, so if you or someone you know is a rising college junior with a passion for helping others, then I hope you’ll apply for the Voyager Scholarship by March 22. 
ESTJ|I hope youll support our #GetHerThere campaign to help us create a brighter future for girls everywhere 
ESTJ|Happy #InternationalDayofEducation! 🎓 Through our work at the @GirlsAlliance, weve been working to empower and support young women around the world to get an education—like Esther, who is part of @GirlUpUganda and dreams of becoming a psychologist. 
ESTJ|I’m thrilled to share that applications for our @ObamaFoundation Leaders USA program are now open! If you’re a young leader between the ages of 24-45, I hope you’ll apply by February 3 at 
ESTJ|Thank you all for the birthday love. I say this a lot, and I mean it—I love you back, and I am so grateful for you supporting me during every step of my journey. ❤️ 
ESTJ|@BarackObama ❤️😘
ESTJ|This #MLKDay, I hope you will join me in honoring the life and legacy of Dr. King by taking at least one action to support your community. You can start by texting three friends and reminding them to check their voter registration with @WhenWeAllVote. 
ESTJ|Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.s fight for justice took patience and perseverance, leadership and compassion, and a love for humanity that all of us should strive for. #MLKDay
ESTJ|That’s why I could not be prouder to honor the counseling team at Woodrow Wilson High School in Los Angeles, CA, for being @ReachHighers 2023 Excellence In College Counseling Award winner. Congrats, @WWHSMules! 🎓🎉 
ESTJ|From breaking down barriers to higher education to helping students manage their mental and emotional health, school counselors play powerful roles in the lives of young people around our country.
ESTJ|I’d love to know if there is an ancestor of yours who has influenced your life. Join the Descendant Challenge by sharing photos and more about your family history using the hashtag #DescendantChallenge. I cant wait to hear about your story, too.
ESTJ|Knowing our history is important. That’s why the @HGMedia film Descendant on Netflix means so much to me. It tells the story of the descendants of the survivors of the Clotilda, which is believed to be the last ship that carried enslaved Africans to the United States.
ESTJ|I was lucky to grow up surrounded by relatives—grandparents, aunties, uncles, and more—with stories to tell and a willingness to share them. Through these conversations, I learned that I was the descendant of slaves and that my grandfather’s grandmother lived her life in bondage. 
ESTJ|And we’re not done just yet. @WhenWeAllVote is fired up to continue this work in 2023 and beyond—we are so grateful to the volunteers, community organizations, and individuals who have joined us in this fight.
ESTJ|Last year, over 100,000 of you volunteered with @WhenWeAllVote to register two million voters (double our goal!), and more than 4,000 lawyers donated more than 45,000 hours of free legal services to protect voting rights.
ESTJ|One year ago today, @WhenWeAllVote and 30 partner organizations came together and pledged to 📣 Recruit and train volunteers 🗳️ Register, educate, and turn out voters ✊🏾 Fight for voting rights We asked you to join us and you did. 
ESTJ|Barack and I started the @ObamaFoundation to support the next generation of leaders. And we are so grateful youve been a part of it. This is just the beginning, and we can’t wait to continue our work together. I hope youll consider donating today at 
ESTJ|From our family to yours, wishing you all a wonderful Christmas filled with happiness, light, and joy! 🎄 As we get ready to wrap up this year and look to the next, let’s remember to reflect on our blessings and channel them into giving back and being kind to those around us. 
ESTJ|What parts of #TheLightWeCarry have resonated with you the most? Id love to hear your reflections and thoughts.
ESTJ|A huge thank you to each and every one of you who’s taken the time to read The Light We Carry! I’ve read so many of your thoughtful reflections and smiled at your photos with family and friends during my book tour. Keep tagging me using #TheLightWeCarry so I can see even more! ❤️
ESTJ|I always love talking to @ConanOBrien! Take a listen to our conversation on his podcast, Conan O’Brien Needs a Friend, as we chat about parenting, our hobbies, and my new book, The Light We Carry. 
ESTJ|I’m so thankful to each and every person who has joined me at one of my book tour stops or picked up a copy of #TheLightWeCarry. I love you all—your support means the world to me. ❤️
ESTJ|The last night of my book tour was truly special. I couldn’t have asked for a better way to end #TheLightWeCarry tour than with my dear friend, @Oprah. 
ESTJ|I was thrilled to recently sit down with some inspiring women— @AngieMartinez, @KellyRowland, Tina Lawson, @WinnieHarlow and @HerMusic—to discuss themes in my book, #TheLightWeCarry. Watch the conversation tonight on @REVOLTtv. 
ESTJ|I was heartbroken to learn about the passing of Stephen tWitch Boss, who I got to know over the years through my Let’s Move! initiative and visits to The Ellen Show. My heart goes out to his wife, Allison, and his three children during this difficult time. 
ESTJ|Los Angeles! Are you ready for our final #TheLightWeCarry show? Can’t wait to sit down tonight with the one and only @Oprah. ✨ 
ESTJ|Thank you to all the folks who joined me in San Francisco for #TheLightWeCarry tour! And to @MicheleNorris, I’m so grateful for your years of friendship and support. I can’t believe we’re almost done with my book tour—one more show to go! 
ESTJ|I’m so excited for tonight’s #TheLightWeCarry show with my friend @MicheleNorris! ❤️ 
ESTJ|Always a good time when I’m with @TraceeEllisRoss! To everyone who joined us, thank you for making this such a fun show. #TheLightWeCarry ✨

ESTJ|What’s something that you’ve picked up as a hobby or practice that has helped you during these last few years? Reply with your thoughts or tag me in your post using #TheLightWeCarry.
ESTJ|During the peak of the pandemic, when everything felt so bleak, the act of stitching, purling, casting on and off is how I kept my anxiety at bay. Practicing it roots me in this idea that I talk about in my book, The Light We Carry called the power of small. 🧶
ESTJ|Every time I tell people how much I love to knit, they seem so surprised! But it truly has become one of my most meaningful (and fun) pastimes. For me, knitting is a release. It lets my hands lead the way as my mind trails behind. #TheLightWeCarry 
ESTJ|Chicago! Thanks for a terrific show—and a special thanks to @hmcghee for leading such a meaningful conversation. It always means so much to be back in my hometown and to see so many of my family, friends, and readers. Thank you for sharing your light with me. #TheLightWeCarry 
ESTJ|.@hmcghee and I are thrilled for tonight’s show and can’t wait to talk about #TheLightWeCarry with all of you! Chicago, are you ready? 
ESTJ|There’s no place like home! Such a fun night in Chicago with David @Letterman and all who joined. #TheLightWeCarry 
ESTJ|Love this! Thank you for coming together and celebrating #TheLightWeCarry. ❤️
ESTJ|I know I can count on @DNice to always bring great vibes, get people dancing, and show everyone a good time. Im grateful that hes helped power the music for each #TheLightWeCarry book tour stop and that he took some time to join us in person yesterday in Atlanta. 
ESTJ|And to those who are following along, thank you for picking up the book and sharing the tools that have helped you along the way. Keep your reflections coming! #TheLightWeCarry
ESTJ|I’m having such a wonderful time seeing so many of you on my #TheLightWeCarry book tour. @TylerPerry, thank you for joining me these last two nights in Atlanta. 
ESTJ|What an amazing crowd and conversation last night at our first #TheLightWeCarry show in Atlanta with my friend @TylerPerry. Can’t wait to do it all again tonight! 
ESTJ|Atlanta! @TylerPerry and I are so excited to talk about my book #TheLightWeCarry with you tonight. 💃🏾 
ESTJ|This #GivingTuesday, I hope you’ll consider giving what you can to support our work at the @GirlsAlliance. Every donation has the power to change a girl’s life—like Streytouch, a student from our global community who dreams of becoming a business leader. 
ESTJ|On this #SmallBusinessSaturday, lets give it up for all the independent bookstores and booksellers for everything they do. Im grateful for their support of #TheLightWeCarry, and I hope all of you will check out your neighborhood bookstore this holiday season and all year round! 
ESTJ|I want to hear from you. What advice would you share about marriage or relationships? #TheLightWeCarry
ESTJ|As an adult, I’ve lived in a number of places, but as far as I’m concerned, I’ve only ever had one real home. My home is my family. My home is Barack. #TheLightWeCarry 
ESTJ|I hope everyone has a wonderful day filled with love, gratitude, and a whole lot of great food. From our family to yours, have a happy Thanksgiving! 
ESTJ|Remember, you have an entire community of people cheering you on – including me and @BetterMakeRoom. We believe in you! 🎓

ESTJ|In Philly with @hodakotb for #TheLightWeCarry tour! 💕 
ESTJ|Philadelphia! Thank you to everybody who joined @GayleKing and me last night on tour. #TheLightWeCarry 🎉 
ESTJ|It was truly a treat to be joined by my friend Elizabeth Alexander for our last show in DC! These are the kind of fulfilling conversations that I hope reading #TheLightWeCarry will spark in your life. Let’s keep the conversation going! 
ESTJ|In #TheLightWeCarry, I write about some of their recent experiences navigating adulthood and everything that comes along with it. It is such a joy to watch them forge their own path in the world. In so many ways, they are my light.
ESTJ|Malia and Sasha continue to make me so proud. They have grown up to become such confident, thoughtful, kind, and honest young women who are so supportive of one another. #TheLightWeCarry 
ESTJ|DC! Thank you for bringing such great energy last night. I had so much fun talking about #TheLightWeCarry with @TheEllenShow and all of you. 
ESTJ|I’d love to hear about the people who are part of your own kitchen table. Tag the friends who are important to you and let them know how much they mean to you. #TheLightWeCarry 💕
ESTJ|In their own way, these women keep me grounded when times are tough. They listen to me vent. They help me see myself. They give me laughter and love. And I’m so grateful for each and every one of them.
ESTJ|I often refer to my close friends as my Kitchen Table. The friends at my table come from all different parts of my life — college, Chicago, DC, and every other period, too. #TheLightWeCarry 
ESTJ|I was thrilled to start my book tour in Washington, DC with @TheEllenShow! To everyone who came out last night — thank you for beginning this journey with me. It means so much. #TheLightWeCarry 💞 
ESTJ|It’s almost time for us to get on stage! So excited to kick off #TheLightWeCarry book tour in Washington, DC with @TheEllenShow! 🎉 
ESTJ|Get your copy today at or wherever books are sold! I can’t wait for you to read it, and I hope youll share your reflections with me using #TheLightWeCarry.
ESTJ|These past few years, I’ve been listening to your stories, reflecting on some of the lessons I’ve learned, and the tools I’ve used to hold it all together. I’m thrilled you’ll be able to read this all in my new book, The Light We Carry! 
ESTJ|The Light We Carry is out tomorrow! ✨ I wanted to share a little snippet of the audiobook with you. Take a listen and pre-order your copy at 
ESTJ|I hope you’ll tune in tonight at 10pm ET on ABC with @RobinRoberts to learn more about my new book, The Light We Carry, and hear from the strong women who I lean on as part of my kitchen table. Photo Credit ABC/George Burns 
ESTJ|#TheLightWeCarry is dedicated to them. I’ll forever be thankful for the flame they lit inside of me.
ESTJ|I wouldn’t be who I am today if it wasn’t for my parents, Fraser and Marian Robinson. The lessons they taught me, the support they gave me, and the love they showed me — that foundation might be the most important gift of my entire journey. 
ESTJ|Because even when the world feels dark and uncertain, we always have the ability to kindle our own light by looking inside ourselves and then sharing it with others. #TheLightWeCarry ❤️ 
ESTJ|Some of these tools are habits. Some are actual physical objects. Others are attitudes and beliefs from my ongoing journey of becoming. I poured a lot into this book, and my hope is that it might give you some ideas for your own journey.
ESTJ|That’s when I began the writing process. I think of #TheLightWeCarry as a toolbox of sorts. It’s a collection of practices and perspectives that I draw on when I need to stay balanced and confident, especially in times of anxiety and stress.
ESTJ|And then, the pandemic hit, leaving us isolated at home during a time of uncertainty. And like everyone else, I had a lot of questions about how to overcome anxiety and fear when it felt like the ground was moving beneath us—and I heard those questions from so many of you, too.
ESTJ|Four years ago, when I released my memoir, Becoming, I traveled across the country and around the world, meeting so many incredible people—including many of you. It was a little scary to share so much of my story for the first time, but I was so moved by your response. 
ESTJ|Today and every day, we thank our veterans and their families for their service to our country. #VeteransDay

ESTJ|Today, Barack and I went back to the White House to unveil our official portraits. It was so exciting to share Sharon Sprung and Robert McCurdys incredible artistry with the world—and to be back in the place we called home for eight years. 
ESTJ|Sharon Sprung is a brilliant artist who joins a small, but mighty group of women who have painted an official White House portrait. Learn more about her and the process that went into making our portraits 
ESTJ|This summer, the @ObamaFoundation provided healthy meals to young people in Chicago through the Local Lunchbox program. Thank you to all the chefs and community members involved. I loved hearing what it meant to the kids to have access to this nutritious and delicious food. 
ESTJ|Congrats on an amazing career, @SerenaWilliams! How lucky were we to be able to watch a young girl from Compton grow up to become one of the greatest athletes of all time. Im proud of you, my friend—and I cant wait to see the lives you continue to transform with your talents.

ESTJ|Malala proved that one girl’s voice can change the world. Since she did it, it makes me believe that I can too. -Dreshta, New York, USA 
ESTJ|Malala is a great woman! She fought for education and for this reason I want to be like her. I admire her, and my class section is even named after her at my school. Claudia, Sololá, Guatemala 
ESTJ|Whenever I’m needing confidence, I look at role models like Malala. She taught me about the importance of education for girls all over the world and how we all have to stand up for each other. I’m committed to doing that. -Allena, Hawai’i, USA 
ESTJ|In my community, many girls don’t finish school. My parents encouraged my education, but there were times when I felt my dreams slipping away. Malala gave me an example of strength and determination to take inspiration from. I’m proud to say I graduated. -Clare, Kampala, Uganda 
ESTJ|As we celebrate #MalalaDay today, we asked young women from the @GirlsAlliance to tell us how @Malala inspires them. Check out what they shared below

ESTJ|Many parents rely on schools to make sure their kids have access to consistent meals. During the summer that need doesnt go away. Im thrilled the @ObamaFoundation is teaming up with Local Lunchbox and local chefs to give young people in Chicago free, healthy meals this summer.
ESTJ|We miss him already, but his spirit lives on in his family members, including my dear friend @ProfessorEA, and all who were lucky enough to be blessed by his presence.
ESTJ|Cliff was an American original—a civil rights trailblazer whose eyes were never shut to injustice but whose heart was always open. He was like a father to me and an inspiration to Barack. We admired the way he fought and learned from the way he led. 
ESTJ|These words were recited by Elizabeth Alexander at Barack’s inauguration in 2009—but they also describe how her father, Cliff Alexander, lived. 
ESTJ|Happy birthday, Malia – and Happy Fourth of July, everybody! 24 years ago, this day became extra special when your wonderful spirit arrived in this world. I’m so proud of the beautiful, caring, and driven young woman you’ve become. I love you so, so much! Love, your Mommy. ❤️ 
ESTJ|My thoughts on the Supreme Courts decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. 
ESTJ|To all those who have been on the frontlines of this issue—calling their representatives, organizing their neighbors, raising awareness in their hometowns thank you. There is a lot of work ahead, but this progress couldn’t have been possible without your efforts.
ESTJ|The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act is a step in the right direction in protecting our children and communities. It demonstrates how much we can accomplish when we work together, even in the wake of today’s disappointing Supreme Court ruling on guns.
ESTJ|For 50 years, #TitleIX has pushed girls to dream bolder and bigger, and has led to some of America’s greatest athletic achievements—from grand slams to gold medals to a women’s World Cup. @ESPN’s 37 Words celebrates that remarkable progress. I loved it—and I know you will too! 
ESTJ|Congrats to the Class of 2022! You’ve persevered through one of the most extraordinary times in our history, and now it’s time to make your mark on our world. I believe in you and will be rooting for you every step of the way! 🎓🎉👏🏾
ESTJ|Barack and I always want to make sure that young people feel confident and capable of making a difference. Thats one of the reasons we created the Futures Series at the @ObamaFoundation, so students on the South Side understand there is no dream too big for them to dream.
ESTJ|Queen @Beyonce, you’ve done it again! Break My Soul is the song we all need right now, and I cant help but dance and sing along while listening to it. Can’t wait for the album! 💃🏿
ESTJ|Happy Father’s Day to dads everywhere! @BarackObama, thanks for being the most loving and caring father to our girls. We love you! ❤️ 
ESTJ|As we remember them, lets commit to protecting those rights in our time and for the generations yet to come. Go to to learn more.
ESTJ|Today is about coming together and honoring those before us who reached for progress, who helped build this country with their bare hands, who marched, fought, and protested—who did everything they could so that we might have a voice and a vote. #Juneteenth
ESTJ|Juneteenth is a day of power—a chance to celebrate our history and our triumphs, our resilience and our struggle.
ESTJ|Now is the time to do all we can to change the culture around voting. I hope you’ll join @WhenWeAllVote in doing this work—we need everyone to get involved and do their part to build a better and more inclusive democracy not only for us, but for the generations to follow.

ESTJ|This #AAPIHeritageMonth, I’m proud to celebrate young leaders like Leināʻala—a student in the @GirlsAlliance in Hawai’i. As she says, My heritage means the world to me. It touches everything I do. This month is all about sharing our pride. Thats how I want to use my voice. 
ESTJ|Democracy is – and always has been – on the line. In Our Unfinished March, @EricHolder dives deep into how our democracy has been fractured and lays out a plan for what we can do to defend it. Its a book worth adding to your summer reading list. 
ESTJ|The one and only @Oprah has been such a wonderful friend to me and Barack over the years—and it meant so much to write about her remarkable legacy for #TIME100. Hope you’ll take a look! 
ESTJ|There’s nothing I love more than meeting with young people. Today, I had the chance to talk with some of the bright high school students from DC with @ReachHigher who shared their stories and plans for the future. I’m so proud of them and cant wait to follow their journeys.

ESTJ|So when you get home from marching, check your voter registration status with @WhenWeAllVote and encourage others to do the same at 
ESTJ|If any of you are questioning whether or not your vote matters, I get it. But remember that state lawmakers are the ones who will determine whether abortion is safe, legal, and accessible in your communities. And we are the ones who determine our state lawmakers. 
ESTJ|But we don’t have to stand idly by while others try to turn back the clock on progress. I’m so inspired by everyone out marching today. And I know that we’re going to see so many folks carrying this energy forward to the elections in November and in every election after that.
ESTJ|It’s been a tough couple of weeks since we saw the leaked SCOTUS draft opinion on abortion. Even if we knew the courts were heading toward this day, it doesn’t make the frustration, grief, and fear any less real.
ESTJ|Decades before our family lived there, First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt planted a Victory Garden on the White House lawn—and Im thrilled to share that the Fruit , Vegetable Garden at the Obama Presidential Center will be named in her honor. I can’t wait for you all to visit! 
ESTJ|Happy #MothersDay! Im so thankful for the love, guidance, and care that my mom has instilled in me. I’ve shared so much of her wisdom with my own daughters over the years. ❤️ 
ESTJ|Happy College Signing Day! 🎓🥳👏🏾 Today, we celebrate everyone making a commitment to get their education at a community college, university, trade school, or the military. I hope you’ll share your plans with @BetterMakeRoom and me using #CollegeSigningDay! 
ESTJ|From an early age, my mom, Marian Robinson, taught me how to think for myself, use my own voice, and understand my own worth. Ahead of #MothersDay, I’m proud to announce that the Opening the White House exhibit at the Obama Presidential Center will be named after her. 💕 
ESTJ|I’d love to hear about a remarkable teacher in your life. Share how they contributed to who you are today and how you are celebrating them during #TeacherAppreciationWeek.
ESTJ|This Teacher Appreciation Week, I wanted to tell you about a teacher in California – Ms. Tsung. Shes been using the interactive resources from our Pass the Love campaign with @PHAnews to teach her 6th graders about food equity! #ThankATeacher 
ESTJ|.@smalonemd and I also spoke about womens health, aging, and menopause not too long ago on The Michelle Obama Podcast from our @HGMedia. Take a listen 
ESTJ|As women, we need to have more open and honest conversations about our bodies – especially as we get older. Heres an important piece about the research and reforms needed to support those experiencing menopause. 
ESTJ|The South Side made my brother Craig and me who we are today, so it was extra special seeing him go back to participate in our @ObamaFoundation Futures Series. By sharing his story, he’s letting these young people know that they can also dream big and accomplish their goals. 
ESTJ|Whether youre going to a community college, a university, or joining the military, tell me where youre headed using #CollegeSigningDay! 🎓🎉
ESTJ|College Signing Day is one of my favorite events of the year, and I can’t wait to celebrate it virtually with @ReachHigher on May 7!
ESTJ|Happy birthday, @CraigMalRob! I couldnt have asked for a better brother and friend. Heres to celebrating 60! ❤️ 
ESTJ|We need to talk about the state of our democracy and the ways we can protect it right from our own communities. Ill be speaking more on this at @WhenWeAllVotes #CultureOfDemocracy Summit, and I hope youll join us from June 10-13 
ESTJ|And even though we’ve reached our goal – our work isn’t done. Let’s keep working until every family, in every zip code, has access to healthy food. Learn more about our Pass the Love campaign with @PHAnews at 🥕🍅🥦🥔 
ESTJ|Thanks to the support of so many people like you who either donated, volunteered, or helped distribute meals – we’ve helped provide meal kits to families in Atlanta, Cleveland, Detroit, Fresno, and Philadelphia. 
ESTJ|Last spring, we launched our Pass the Love campaign with @PHAnews with the goal of distributing one million healthy meal kits to families in need. I’m excited to share that we’ve not only met our goal, but surpassed it! 💕 
ESTJ|I’m so excited for this group of Asia-Pacific Leaders to come together, share their ideas, and develop new skills to create even more change this year. Welcome—I can’t wait to follow your journeys!
ESTJ|Every Easter, I am reminded of the power of faith and community. Wishing all those celebrating today a day of joy and renewal. 
ESTJ|Happy #NationalGardeningDay! 🥦🥕🍎 At just 6-years-old, Kendall is already inspiring people of all ages with her love of farming as Georgia’s youngest certified farmer. Her story is a reminder that youre never too young or old to get started. Share your garden photos with me!

ESTJ|Happy #NationalPetDay, Sunny! I just love spending time with my furry gal—whose snuggles bring so much joy and delight to everyone she meets. ❤️🐾 
ESTJ|While in Chicago, Barack attended a @ChicagoBulls game with students from the @GirlsAlliance and @MBKAlliance. These young people are so hard working and bright—and they deserved this night of fun! 
ESTJ|I was so moved to see Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson confirmed this afternoon. Like so many of you, I can’t help but feel a sense of pride—a sense of joy—to know that this deserving, accomplished Black woman will be a part of the highest court in the land. 
ESTJ|In her book, she uses the lens of the 2020 movement for racial justice to explore its impact on the Black experience—the joy, the fear, the frustration. It is powerful, poignant, and deeply moving. I hope you’ll check it out. 
ESTJ|Heres to you, @ProfessorEA! Not only is she an exceptional author and educator, she is also a trusted friend—one whose insights have challenged me to see the world in new and different ways. I’m excited to share that her latest book, The Trayvon Generation, is available now. 
ESTJ|Antilynching legislation was first introduced over a century ago—and failed to pass over 200 times. Now, the Emmett Till Antilynching Act is a chance to reckon with our history, and move in a new direction—one that makes this country safer and more just for us all.
ESTJ|Yesterday, President Biden signed the Emmett Till Antilynching Act into law—finally designating lynching as a federal hate crime in the United States. For many Black folks, this historic moment comes with a lot of different emotions—I know it does for me.
ESTJ|Congratulations, @Questlove and the team at @SummerOfSoul, for your #Oscar win! Barack and I were so moved by this celebration of Black music, culture, and joy. What you did in telling this overlooked story is so important—and we are grateful for artists like you leading the way!
ESTJ|This #WomensHistoryMonth, I am thinking about the next generation of girls who are working to make our world a better place—like these talented young women I met in Hawai’i with the @GirlsAlliance. I know youll be as inspired by their stories as I am.

ESTJ|Congrats to @NPSIBelieves 2022 Power of Hope Award winners! I am grateful for the work these school counselors, teachers, and administrators have done to ensure their students have the skills and support systems they need to pursue their dreams and prepare for the future. 🎓👏🏾

ESTJ|Fifteen years ago, Barack announced his candidacy in Springfield. It was bitter cold, but as far as my eyes could see, there were people everywhere. People from all over the state, from different backgrounds and identities—all who believed in his promise. All who believed in us. 
ESTJ|Happy National School Counseling Week to all of the incredible school counselors who selflessly support our students each and every day! Thank you for all that you do to empower our nation’s young people. Congrats to the 2022 School Counselor of the Year, Alma Lopez! #NSCW22 🎉 
ESTJ|When we work together, we can change the culture around voting and fight voter suppression. Thats why I’m bringing together some friends in the fight for our vote with @WhenWeAllVote. I hope you’ll join us! Text join to 56005 to get involved. 
ESTJ|Nine years ago, we lost Hadiya Pendleton to the tragedy of gun violence. I know her loss is still devastating for so many. That’s why Barack and I hope that the Hadiya Pendleton Winter Garden at the Obama Presidential Center can share her light with the world. See how here

ESTJ|Dr. Biden is one of the most passionate, joyful, and hardworking people I know. She’s done a wonderful job making the role of @FLOTUS her own—working to support military families, promote cancer research, and support educators throughout this pandemic. I’m so proud of her! ❤️
ESTJ|When Barack and I left the White House, we asked you to help us shape the @ObamaFoundations work. Since then, we’ve launched nine programs and connected countless leaders around the world. This is just the beginning, and we can’t wait for whats next. 
ESTJ|André Leon Talley was a one-of-a-kind presence who changed the face of fashion and beauty for a generation of girls just like me. He will be missed, but I know his legacy will continue inspiring people for years to come. 
ESTJ|I’m so excited to welcome the newest cohort of @ObamaFoundation Europe Leaders. Looking forward to learning more about your work and seeing the progress you make this year! 🌍
ESTJ|Here’s to a sweet 58th! Thank you so much for your outpouring of love. Whether you texted, emailed, or posted on social media, every birthday message I received today meant a lot to me. Looking forward to seeing what this upcoming year has in store. 💕 
ESTJ|I hope you’ll tune in tonight at 7pm ET on @BET to see Yara Shahidi and I speak with some talented young people who are owning their stories and becoming who they want to be. #BecomingOnBET 💕 
ESTJ|One of the best ways to honor Dr. Kings legacy is to take action to help protect voting rights in our country. Text ‘MLK’ to 56005 and @WhenWeAllVote will send some details you can use to call elected officials today and urge them to pass the Freedom to Vote John R. Lewis Act. 
ESTJ|What a fitting tribute to have Dr. Maya Angelou become the first Black woman on the U.S. quarter—she was a phenomenal woman whose comfort in her own skin made so many of us feel seen in ours. 
ESTJ|Im thrilled to share that well soon be distributing healthy meal kits to families in Fresno as part of our Pass the Love campaign with @PHAnews! Were so close to reaching our goal of providing one million meals, but we need your support. Join us 
ESTJ|To all the teachers and school counselors out there—thank you for everything you do. The love and support you give to your students day in and day out could not be more important, especially in times like these. I’m proud to join @ReachHigher and @CFPExtraYard in celebrating you!
ESTJ|Lets make sure that every voice is heard and every vote is counted in the 2022 midterm elections and beyond. Take the pledge 
ESTJ|In 2020, millions made their voices heard at the polls. But now, folks who oppose that progress are making it harder to vote. That’s why I’m asking you to join @WhenWeAllVote and 30 other organizations to turn out more voters and urge Congress to pass voting rights legislation. 
ESTJ|So glad you were able to watch! 😊 Dont forget to tell your friends and family to register to vote with @WhenWeAllVote at 
ESTJ|These are some of my favorite behind-the-scenes moments from my time on the set of @BlackishABC! Make sure to tune into the premiere tonight at 930pm ET on ABC. #WWAVBlackish 
ESTJ|You can set a reminder to tune in at 930pm ET on ABC—can’t wait for you all to see this episode! 
ESTJ|It was fun being on set with @TraceeEllisRoss and the cast and crew of @BlackishABC! Join me and @WhenWeAllVote tonight as we watch the farewell season premiere—and don’t forget to tell me what you think of the episode using #WWAVBlackish. So grateful to be a part of it! 
ESTJ|Happy New Year from me and my boo! 🎉🥳 Wishing you all a year filled with happiness, love, and good health. 
ESTJ|Betty White broke barriers, defied expectations, served her country, and pushed us all to laugh. Barack and I join so many around the world who will miss the joy she brought to the world. I know our Bo is looking forward to seeing her up in heaven. 
ESTJ|Merry Christmas from our family to yours! Barack and I send our best wishes to you all for a safe, healthy, and joyful holiday season. 🎄🎁💫 
ESTJ|I loved sending this surprise message to the bright students at @WMSFA! They’ve been reading the young readers edition of Becoming and working with @ReachHigher to share their own #IAmBecoming story. I want to hear yours, too—so reply and tell me more about your story! 💝 
ESTJ|And I couldnt be more grateful for all the medical professionals—the doctors, nurses, hospital staff, and more—whove continued to work every day of this pandemic to protect us all. Thank you for all that you do. ❤️
ESTJ|I’m joining these incredible moms to share a message—how important it is to get fully vaccinated against COVID-19, and get a booster, too. Protect your loved ones and those around you by going to to find a vaccine near you. Do it for us moms. 
ESTJ|Im so proud of the work the @ObamaFoundation has accomplished this year, and I can’t wait for you all to see what’s ahead.
ESTJ|In this season of giving, I hope youll donate to our Pass the Love campaign with @PHAnews. Weve delivered more than 888,000 healthy meal kits to families in Atlanta, Cleveland, Detroit, and Philadelphia. And with your support, we can reach even more 
ESTJ|It was wonderful meeting with so many remarkable young people while we were back in Chicago last week. Hearing their stories reminded me so much of my own. They give me so much hope, and I can’t wait to see the impact they’ll have on this community. 
ESTJ|I had so much fun with these bright young people from Hyde Park Academy! I loved hearing about their ideas, passions, and resilience. My message to them—and to every young person out there—is to keep learning and never give up on your dreams. Barack and I believe in you! 
ESTJ|Barack and I had so much fun surprising everyone at the @ComerChildrens Hospital. Happy holidays! ❤️ 
ESTJ|Growing up on the South Side made me who I am today, and I was thrilled to meet with some wonderful young women from Chicago to talk about our work with the @GirlsAlliance. I see myself in these girls—and Im so proud of each of them. 
ESTJ|Everyone should have access to healthy, affordable food. This #GivingTuesday, I’m asking you to support our Pass the Love campaign with @PHAnews, which has been delivering healthy meal kits to families in need. I hope you’ll get involved and donate at 
ESTJ|Tomorrow is #GivingTuesday, and as you think about where to donate this year, I want to introduce you to sixteen-year-old Sonia—an 11th grader who lives in Debauché, Haiti. Your support to our @GirlsAlliance Fund can help girls like her around the world 
ESTJ|Chicago is filled with wonderful small businesses that enrich our communities and our lives. On this #SmallBusinessSaturday, I hope you’ll check out these Black-owned businesses on the South Side—and make it a point to support a small business near you! 
ESTJ|When I was younger, I didnt often see a lot of characters who looked like me on TV or in movies. I know that was the case for so many girls and boys, too. So I hope you’ll watch Ada Twist, Scientist with your family on @Netflix!
ESTJ|So thrilled that Ada Twist, Scientist made her debut in the Thanksgiving Day Parade! This brainy little girl is teaching young viewers how important it is to be curious, and how anyone can be a scientist—no matter their age or background. 
ESTJ|Happy Thanksgiving from Sunny and our entire family! We hope you all have a wonderful day, giving thanks for everyone you love. ❤️ 
ESTJ|The holidays are a perfect time to give back—and the truth is, there is no greater gift than education. That’s why I was thrilled to kick off the holiday season in New York with the @GirlsAlliance in support of girls education and empowerment around the world.
ESTJ|Waffles + Mochi are back—and just in time to celebrate the holidays with a couple of friends! We had some fun starting a new tradition, Freezie Day—along with some new songs and adventures. Watch our new Holiday Feast episode with your family today on @Netflix! 🎄❄🎁 
ESTJ|I am so proud of these young leaders who are putting in the work to build on their leadership skills, connect with one another, and make a bigger impact across Africa. The work theyre doing couldn’t be more important. Barack and I will be cheering these #ObamaLeaders on!
ESTJ|So, I’d love to hear from you today! Reply and share your own #IAmBecoming story, and let me know what youve discovered about yourself. I can’t wait to hear from you! 💕
ESTJ|I cant believe it’s been three years since Becoming was released! I’m grateful for every person who read my memoir and shared their own #IAmBecoming story with me—whether it was in person on the book tour or here on social media. I’ve loved hearing you reflect on your journeys. 
ESTJ|Today and every day, I could not be more grateful for the extraordinary service and commitment of our nation’s troops, veterans, and their families. I hope we all can find a way to give back to all those who have given us so much. #VeteransDay 
ESTJ|I love this! This is exactly why we created Ada Twist, Scientist, through Higher Ground – to inspire budding young scientists like yours to experiment on their own. Hoping he makes some great discoveries!
ESTJ|Vote in-person or drop off your ballot by the time polls close. Head to to find your polling place. 
ESTJ|Today is Election Day! From city hall and the governor’s mansion to the school board and the courts — state and local elections can have a profound impact on your day-to-day life. So if your city or state has an election today, make sure your voice is heard by voting!
ESTJ|Barack and I always loved celebrating Halloween back at the White House. I hope all those trick-or-treating tonight have a safe—yet spooky—time! 👻🎃 
ESTJ|I’ve long been a fan of @BlackishABC’s wit and all-around brilliance, and it was such a thrill to join in for an episode. I can’t wait for you all to see it! ❤️
ESTJ|I’m so encouraged that the @POTUS and @VP have issued the first-ever national strategy on gender equity and equality. It’s about making sure that every single person can reach their full potential—in our country and around the world. It’s what real leadership looks like.
ESTJ|So this can’t be the end of our fight. We’re going to keep working to protect access to the ballot box at @WhenWeAllVote—and we hope youll join us 
ESTJ|And right now, their goal is to discourage us. We can’t let that happen. Passing this bill—and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act—is our best path toward creating a democracy that truly responds to our votes and our voices. That’s what America should always be about.
ESTJ|This week, Senate Republicans voted against even beginning debate on critical voting rights legislation. Make no mistake, the Freedom to Vote Act is a commonsense bill to protect the fundamental tenet of our democracy—the right to vote.
ESTJ|Congrats, @ChicagoSky! So proud of this team for winning their first @WNBA championship. 👏🏾🎉
ESTJ|Happy birthday to a thoughtful, compassionate, and relentless leader—the one and only @KamalaHarris. We are so lucky to have you serving our country! 
ESTJ|Im proud of all the students pursuing higher education—it isnt easy, but your hard work will pay off! If you’re a high school senior or college student, completing the FAFSA is one way to get money to support you on your educational journey. Get started 
ESTJ|A couple years ago, the Florida state government rolled back a measure that would have given many formerly incarcerated Floridians their right to vote. Now, they can only cast a ballot if they pay off their incarceration debt. Its essentially a poll tax. 
ESTJ|Happy International #DayoftheGirl! Today I’m celebrating the promise that exists within every girl. When we invest in that promise, we empower them to change their communities for the better. Join me and the @GirlsAlliance in supporting girls’ education 
ESTJ|It’s never too early to start understanding the power of your vote. That’s why I loved seeing how @LaRonHines is getting these preschoolers to think about it! Check it out, and update your registration with @whenweallvote at 
ESTJ|How it started vs. how it’s going Happy anniversary, Barack—love you! ❤️😘 
ESTJ|I can’t wait for you all to tune into our latest production from Higher Ground—Ada Twist, Scientist! Its a show that teaches young people to be curious about the world around them. I hope youll watch it with your families on @Netflix, and let me know what you think! 👩🏿‍🔬👨🏻‍🔬👩🏼‍🔬👨🏽‍🔬 
ESTJ|One of the greatest honors of my life is being a proud Chicagoan—a daughter of the South Side. When it came time to decide where Barack and I would build the Obama Presidential Center, we knew it had to be in the place we call home. We can’t wait to see this project come to life. 
ESTJ|Barack and I loved surprising the incredible women in the Chicago Women in Trades, some of whom will be helping build the Obama Presidential Center. I am so proud of CWIT for opening doors for girls and women across the city—and even prouder to see these women leading the way! 💪🏾 
ESTJ|Barack and I are thrilled to officially break ground on the Obama Presidential Center today! This moment means a lot to us, and we hope youll tune in for the ceremony to learn why 
ESTJ|The South Side of Chicago is where I was born and raised, and its where @BarackObama and I started our family. Were thrilled to head back home next week to celebrate the virtual groundbreaking for the Obama Presidential Center! ❤
ESTJ|When we all vote and make our voices heard, we can change our democracy for the better. Join me tonight at 8pm ET for a virtual rally to kick off @WhenWeAllVotes National Voter Registration Day Week of Action! I hope to see you there #BackToTheBallotBox 
ESTJ|It was an honor getting to speak with @DrSianProctor and the incredible #Inspiration4 crew. Theyre inspiring us all with their courage, curiosity, and passion. Im thinking of all the young people wholl be looking up to this crew and dreaming big thanks to them. Ad astra! 💫🚀 
ESTJ|The refugees arriving to the United States from Afghanistan have stories just like ours. They have big dreams for themselves, hopes for their families, and lives they wish to build. I hope youll join me and @WelcomeUs in welcoming them to the United States!
ESTJ|If we want to fight back against bills like this, we’ve got to organize state by state and block by block to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the For the People Act. I hope you’ll join me.
ESTJ|When we launched the #ObamaScholars program three years ago, we hoped to equip the next generation of leaders with the tools and skills they could use to change their communities for the better. To our newest Scholars—congratulations! We can’t wait to see the good you’ll do.
ESTJ|Hurricane Ida has left millions of people without power, food, and shelter throughout the South. In times like these, we’ve got to lift up one another. I hope you’ll click through to support families who can use your help 
ESTJ|But this is far from a done deal. Like so many others before it, this bill could fail in the Senate. So I’m asking you to make your voice heard. Join me and @whenweallvote, and ask your Senator to support this bill 
ESTJ|Last night, the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act passed in the House of Representatives. Today, I’m celebrating this victory. Because it’s not every day that a landmark bill like this—a bill that will give a voice to so many—has a chance to become law. 
ESTJ|As we mark the 56th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, @StaceyAbrams and I are calling on you to reach out to your members of Congress and ask them to pass the For the People Act and John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. Join us 
ESTJ|Of all of your accomplishments, I know that being a present, loving father to our girls tops them all. Thank you for never letting the weight of the world get in the way of being a wonderful husband and father. Happy 60th birthday, @BarackObama! 💕 
ESTJ|Happy birthday to the woman who taught me how to think for myself, use my voice, and show up authentically in this world. Your belief that I mattered, even when I was just a little girl, led me to where I am today. Thank you for being the ultimate role model. Love you, mom! 💗 
ESTJ|Am I good enough? Yes, I am. The mantra I practice daily. @SimoneBiles, we are proud of you and we are rooting for you. Congratulations on the the silver medal, Team @USA! 🎊
ESTJ|Everyone deserves to have their voices heard and their votes counted, and I can’t think of a better way to honor Congressman Lewis than by turning these bills into law.
ESTJ|All across our country, the sacred right to vote that he marched and bled for is being threatened. That’s why we’ve got to do everything in our power to pass the #ForThePeopleAct and the #JohnLewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.
ESTJ|A year ago today, we lost Congressman John Lewis. As we celebrate the king of good trouble—his legacy of perseverance, his ability to find moments of joy and lightness in the midst of real struggle—we should also recommit ourselves to building the future he envisioned. 
ESTJ|Im excited to announce that Philadelphia will be our next partner city for our Pass the Love campaign with @PHAnews! We’ll be distributing healthy meal kits to families soon, and with your support, we can reach even more families in need. Donate at 
ESTJ|During quarantine, I picked up knitting as a hobby—and discovered how fulfilling it can be to turn small stitches into something big and beautiful. Thats why I loved talking with Shayna Rose, a 14-year-old reporter with Vogue Knitting Magazine about it. Hope you’ll listen! 
ESTJ|Wishing a very happy birthday to @Malala! As she often points out, there are so many girls like her all around the world, all of whom deserve a chance to learn and grow and blossom into the kind of women they want to be. This #MalalaDay, let’s commit to lifting them up. 
ESTJ|Barack and I had a great time speaking with @chrisdocnee, @pramsey342, and @HERMusicx about We The People, our latest series from Higher Ground. We talked about the power of music in educating young people about democracy. We hope youll check it out! 
ESTJ|Yes, Zaila! We are so, so proud of you! 👏🏾 
ESTJ|Happy Fourth of July, everybody—and also, happy 23rd birthday to our dear Malia! It’s been a few years since we took this photo, but I know that she’ll always be my sweet little girl. Malia, we love you, and are so excited to see what this year will bring for you! ❤️ 
ESTJ|The pandemic’s impact in India has been devastating—and sadly, it also poses new barriers to girls’ education. That’s why the @GirlsAlliance is supporting three new organizations that are working to ensure that girls can keep learning safely. Learn more 
ESTJ|The first time I met Amy Sherald, our connection was instant. From the way she carried herself to the art she created, I knew she was the artist to paint my portrait. Tonight, were chatting with Thelma Golden about the #ObamaPortraitsTour at @artinstitutechi. Join us at 6pm ET!
ESTJ|Im so thrilled to hear that @YouTubes Creators for Change on Girls Education Special won the @DaytimeEmmys for Outstanding Daytime Non-Fiction Special! Watch it now to learn about some of the remarkable girls and organizations in the @GirlsAlliance

ESTJ|If you haven’t seen it yet, @itskerrii’s race at the Olympic Trials is something to behold—but her grace and grit in this interview might be even more special. We are all so proud of you, Sha’Carri! Cant wait to see what you do in Tokyo! 👏🏾

ESTJ|Champ was such a good boy, and we know how much he meant to your family over the years. Barack and I are sending all our love to you, @POTUS, and the entire Biden family. ❤️
ESTJ|Its up to each of us to work to protect our democracy and expand our voting rights. There’s too much on the line. Take action with @WhenWeAllVote this weekend. Call your senators and tell them to support the #ForThePeopleAct 
ESTJ|Right now, we have the opportunity to enact voting reforms, expand voting rights, and stop dozens of voter suppression bills aimed at limiting access to the ballot box for people across the country by passing the #ForThePeopleAct.
ESTJ|Lets celebrate #Juneteenth becoming a federal holiday by recognizing the generations of enslaved Black people who fought so hard for their freedom. One of the best ways to do that is by fortifying our sacred right to vote. 
ESTJ|It’s almost #FathersDay, so I’m thinking a lot about my dad and reflecting on some of the memories we shared growing up. I’d love to hear about the fathers in your life—what qualities you value in them, what makes them unique, and what the best advice they’ve given you has been. 
ESTJ|Happy birthday to my darling Sasha! I am so grateful for every laugh we’ve shared — and everything you’ve taught me over the years. You’ll always be my little girl, but I couldn’t be prouder of the woman you are becoming. Love you so much! 🎉🥳💗 
ESTJ|Thinking of you today, Breonna. 🖤 Artwork by Amy Sherald 
ESTJ|Happy birthday, @DrBiden! You’re such a great friend—and even better wife, mom, and grandmother. Thank you for leading with such grace and empathy, and for being so authentically you. Here’s to more laughing, more singing, and good times in the months and years ahead. 💕 
ESTJ|The ripple effects from COVID-19 continue to threaten girls’ education around the globe. That’s why I’m asking everyone, everywhere, to join me in supporting @GPforEducation. #RaiseYourHand for girls’ education 
ESTJ|I can’t wait for you all to see We The People! This Higher Ground project is filled with the songs and the heart of so many of our favorite artists—but even more, it’s a rallying cry for a rising generation that’s ready to take on the world. Watch it on @Netflix on July 4! 🇺🇸
ESTJ|I’d love to hear more about your graduation day. Send me a photo or shout out another graduate using #DearGrad and #ReachHigher! 🎓👨🏿‍🎓🎓👩‍🎓🎓
ESTJ|Life threw an awful lot at you this year, and you didn’t blink. Instead, you pushed yourself harder and overcame the obstacles in your way. I am so proud of you—and please know I’ll be rooting for you in the months and years ahead.
ESTJ|Congratulations, Class of 2021! You overcame so much this year with grace and humor. You should be incredibly proud of everything you’ve accomplished. 🎉
ESTJ|William Buddy Carter is retiring after 47 years as a butler at the White House and the Blair House. Barack and I are so grateful to have had his warmth, charm, and dignity by our side for eight of those years. Congratulations, Buddy! 
ESTJ|His work has been read (and re-read, and re-read) tens of millions of times over the years, one generation’s gift to the next. Thank you @EricCarle for filling our lives with so much wonder and joy. 💕🐛
ESTJ|I’m sending all my love to Gianna and to the rest of the Floyd family today. Her dad did change the world, and now it’s up to the rest of us to continue changing it for the better. 💕
ESTJ|All of us have a role to play to hold our leaders accountable and speak out about injustice. Let’s make sure that Daddy changed the world isn’t a fleeting moment online, but a lasting change across the country.
ESTJ|It’s been a year since those horrifying 8 minutes and 46 seconds stole George Floyd’s life. Today, I am thinking of this clip of his daughter Gianna, and all the young people out there who have seen so much, but refuse to give up hope. 
ESTJ|You can join the fun, too! And for every badge you earn at the link below, @Walmart will donate to our Pass the Love campaign!

ESTJ|Always amazed by you, @SimoneBiles! Keep shining — we’re rooting for you! 😍✨ 
ESTJ|This was fun! Had some laughs with @StephenAtHome and even raised $9k for our Pass the Love campaign with @PHAnews. I hope youll support our Pass the Love campaign by donating at

ESTJ|My work with the @GirlScouts has always been so rewarding for me—and I absolutely loved speaking with some of the incredible girls in the Becoming Me program about the young readers’ edition of Becoming. Take a look! #IAmBecoming 💚 
ESTJ|I just loved this story of Tani Adewumi, a 10-year-old Nigerian refugee who’s already a chess master! He’s a reminder of the extraordinary potential within every young person—and our duty to help them reach it.

ESTJ|This afternoon was a difficult one for our family. We said goodbye to our best friend—Bo—after a battle with cancer. We are grateful for the love you showed him over the years. Please hug the furry members of your family a little closer tonight—and give them a belly rub from us. 
ESTJ|I love these #MothersDay cards drawn by students in the @GirlsAlliance community. Send one to your mom to thank her for supporting you—and if you can, donate to girls education projects in her honor through the Girls Opportunity Alliance Fund.

ESTJ|This #EarthDay, @GirlsAlliance, @MalalaFund, and @GirlRising are teaming up to spotlight five young women who are working to protect our planet and create a brighter future for all of us. Read their stories at @GlblCtzn 
ESTJ|State lawmakers are making it harder to register to vote and cast a ballot. I hope you’ll join me in urging the Senate to pass the #ForThePeopleAct. Together, we can take a stand against voter suppression. Take action with @WhenWeAllVote 
ESTJ|We all want to be with our family and friends again, and the best way to make that happen is by getting the vaccine as soon as it’s available to you. I have my vaccine squad—do you? Reach out to five friends or family members to make sure theyre vaccinated and tag them below! 
ESTJ|Barack and I started Higher Ground to give exciting new voices a platform to tell great stories. Were proud to share Season 2 of @meuceph’s Tell Them, I Am—a podcast we think you’ll love as much as we do. Listen now on Spotify 
ESTJ|Ive loved seeing so many families get inspired to cook and try new recipes at home after watching Waffles + Mochi—and if you’re looking for more inspiration, here’s a fun and easy recipe to make fruit sushi. Give it a try and share your photos with us using #WafflesAndMochi! 
ESTJ|It’s been heartening to see so many parents and children reading Becoming, and that’s why I’m thrilled to be joining the @ScaryMommyBooks Club for a conversation with families whove been reading it together on Monday, April 12 at 7pm ET—see you then 
ESTJ|I know we all miss spending time with the ones we love––I’m personally looking forward to seeing my mom again and giving her a big hug. 💕 I hope you will get vaccinated once it’s available to you, and please talk to your loved ones to do the same.

ESTJ|The #ForThePeopleAct is a chance to reaffirm that in America, the power rests with the people. It’s our best chance in a generation to protect and strengthen our democracy. So I hope you’ll join me and the @WhenWeAllVote team in supporting this bill 
ESTJ|I’m heartbroken by these recent tragedies of gun violence, and I just keep thinking about all the leaders who won’t take a stand to save lives and yet line up to pass bills that make it harder for us to vote.

ESTJ|One of my favorite parts about sharing my story in Becoming has been having such wonderful conversations with so many of you about your own stories. Here’s a quick look at some of the folks I’ve spoken with recently—it was great to connect with so many of you! #IAmBecoming 
ESTJ|When you can get the COVID-19 vaccine, I hope you do—Barack and I are certainly glad we did. It’s our best shot at beating this virus, looking out for one another, and getting back to some of the things we miss. Getting vaccinated will save lives—and that life could be yours. 
ESTJ|So excited that Waffles + Mochi comes out on Netflix next week—and in collaboration with @PHAnews, our Pass the Love campaign will seek to address food insecurity by providing more than one million meals to families in need. Hope you’ll get involved

ESTJ|When young people from my old neighborhood on the South Side see the words You are America on the exterior of the Obama Presidential Center, I hope they believe it. Because they matter. They belong. And they have the power to shape this country for the better.
ESTJ|Congratulations to the finalists and winners of @ReachHigher, @CommonApp, and @NPSIBelieves inaugural Power of Hope Award! And thank you to all the folks who work to ensure our school counselors are supported every single day.
ESTJ|I’m thrilled to see that the House of Representatives has passed the #ForThePeopleAct. Now, I urge the Senate to follow suit—nothing is more important to our democracy than safeguarding our right to vote. Join @WhenWeAllVote tonight and take action

ESTJ|The young readers’ and paperback edition of Becoming comes out tomorrow! I hope that as you’re reading my story, you’ll also think about your own—because it’s the most beautiful gift you’ll ever have. So share your story with me using #IAmBecoming! 
ESTJ|Black leaders, artists, and change-makers have shaped our culture since this country’s founding. Their contributions are so powerful, and I hope youll join me in celebrating their legacies in #BlackRenaissance. Watch now on @YouTube

ESTJ|School counselors have been such an important support system for our students as they’ve navigated this difficult year. I couldn’t be more grateful for their work—this year and every year. Congrats to @ASCAs 2021 School Counselor of the Year, Olivia Carter! #ReachHigher 
ESTJ|Like so many of you, I was moved as I watched @TheAmandaGorman read her poem at the inauguration. I first met her back in 2016, and over the years, Ive seen her continue to inspire people with her words. Im so proud of the young woman she has become. 
ESTJ|As a girl from the South Side, I can’t wait to bring the Obama Presidential Center to life. It’s a chance to bring people together, foster the next generation of leaders, and invest in a community with so much potential. Thank you to every Chicagoan who helped make this possible!
ESTJ|💃🏾 I’m so excited to share that we are releasing new young readers’ and paperback editions of Becoming on March 2! Sharing my story was one of the most freeing experiences of my life, and I couldn’t be more thrilled to keep the conversation going with all of you. #IAmBecoming 
ESTJ|Ryleigh , Zayden, you nailed it! 😍💕 📷 itsallry on IG 
ESTJ|I’ll miss her dearly, but I smile knowing how many people she inspired, just like me, to walk a little taller, speak a little more freely, and live a little bit more like God intended.
ESTJ|She was the personification of beauty, grace, wisdom, and strength, carrying forward a flame that not only guided her for 96 pathbreaking years but lit the way for so many of us.
ESTJ|What struck me every time I spent time with Cicely Tyson was not necessarily her star power—though that was evident enough—it was her humanity. Just by walking into a room, she had this way of elevating everyone around her. 
ESTJ|The Fabulous Ladies Book Club is an example of what is possible when people come together to help their community in times of need. Their incredible organizing work has helped so many people in their town get the COVID-19 vaccine. Way to go, ladies! 👏🏾 
ESTJ|On International #EducationDay, I’m celebrating the perseverance of students and teachers around the world—including organizations in the @GirlsAlliance that are helping to keep girls learning safely during the pandemic. Support their work today 
ESTJ|With her strong and poignant words, @TheAmandaGorman reminds us of the power we each hold in upholding our democracy. Keep shining, Amanda! I cant wait to see what you do next. 💕 #BlackGirlMagic Photo credit Rob Carr 
ESTJ|With so much going on, Dr. King’s leadership is as steadying a force as it’s ever been. I’ve been reflecting a lot on his example, and how it might help us move forward after these last four years. #MLKDay 
ESTJ|Like all of you, I’ve been feeling so many emotions since yesterday. I tried to put my thoughts down here 
ESTJ|🚨 Hey Georgia! If you still have your mail-in ballot, return it to a drop-off location before 7 PM ET today. Find one near you at Lets get it done! 🚨
ESTJ|It’s #ElectionDay in Georgia! If you’re heading to the polls today, get there before they close at 7 PM ET. If you still need to find your polling place or ballot drop-off location for your absentee ballot, go to to get started with @WhenWeAllVote. 
ESTJ|Because in America, everyone’s voice matters. And that’s still the truth, no matter what some folks want you to believe.
ESTJ|If you live in Georgia, make sure you vote for @ReverendWarnock and @Ossoff in tomorrow’s U.S. Senate runoffs—and make sure everybody you know does the same. If you’ve already received a mail-in ballot, take it to a drop-box or vote in person at your polling place tomorrow.
ESTJ|So if Georgians elect @ReverendWarnock and @Ossoff, we’ll take another step toward cleaning up the mess of the past four years. And we’ll send a message to any politician who puts themselves and their ambition above our system of self-government.
ESTJ|These runoffs will decide whether President-Elect Biden has a Senate that will work with him rather than just obstruct him at every turn.
ESTJ|Tomorrow’s runoffs in Georgia will decide whether the U.S. Senate is run by those who’ve shown their willingness to tear down our democracy—or whether it’ll be run by those who will actually get to work on the monumental challenges before us.
ESTJ|This is why we can’t just vote for President and think that our job is done.
ESTJ|And this is just unconscionable at a time when a staggering number of Americans are dying every day from a virus that was downplayed for far too long. It’s unconscionable to focus on overturning an election rather than helping struggling families or distributing a vaccine.
ESTJ|Your vote is your voice. It’s your power. And right now, from the President of the United States on down, we’re seeing and hearing just how desperate some are to take that power away. They want us to believe that their pride is more important than our democracy.
ESTJ|Tomorrow’s the last day to vote in the Georgia runoffs for the U.S. Senate and it couldn’t be more important that you make your voice heard. Find your polling place at and make sure you know your voting rights 
ESTJ|The last day to vote in the Georgia runoff for the U.S. Senate is this Tuesday, January 5th. If you’re voting in-person on #ElectionDay, you will need an ID. Take a few minutes today to make sure you’re ready to make your voice heard with @WhenWeAllVote and @VoteRiders. 
ESTJ|Georgia, it’s not too late to join the more than two million people who’ve voted early in the runoff election for the U.S. Senate. Go to to find an early polling location and make sure your friends and family have a plan to vote.
ESTJ|Wishing you light, love, and wonder during this holiday season. May the coming year bring us all joy and peace. 
ESTJ|This brought a smile to my face—as do my memories of seeing @RoomtoRead’s work in Vietnam last year with the @GirlsAlliance. Im so inspired by these girls and Room to Read’s efforts to ensure that the pandemic doesn’t derail their dreams of getting an education. ❤️
ESTJ|Lawrence Jackson had a knack for capturing some of our most candid moments in the White House, including this one. Hes a tremendous photographer and a wonderful person—and his book features a collection of memories Ill always cherish. 
ESTJ|Georgia! Tuesday, January 5th, is the last day to vote in the U.S. Senate runoffs, and your vote could make all the difference in this election. Go to to get the information you need to request your ballot, vote early in-person, or vote on Election Day. 
ESTJ|Early voting starts today in Georgia for the U.S. Senate runoff elections! Making your voice heard could not be more important—so make a plan to vote early and check in with your friends and family to do the same. 
ESTJ|Georgia, let’s do this one more time! The runoff elections for the U.S. Senate are on Tuesday, January 5th, and early voting starts this Monday, December 14th. Go to to get the information you need to make your plan to vote. 
ESTJ|I’ve long admired the art of @josefannialbers, and I knew I wanted to include some of their pieces when we redesigned the Old Family Dining Room. I just loved seeing their work on display every day at the White House, and I know so many others did, too.
ESTJ|Make sure to fill out your FAFSA–the Free Application for Federal Student Aid–every year that you’re enrolled in college. It’s the key that can help unlock free money for your education. Complete the FAFSA right now at 
ESTJ|Keep up the great work, @One4OneDesserts! Youre making such a big difference right now.
ESTJ|This #GivingTuesday, meet some of the remarkable girls from the @GirlsAlliance global community, along with a few of the organizations that are supporting them during the pandemic. And, if you’re able, donate to support global girls education today 
ESTJ|I’m so proud of Barack for this candid, reflective, and beautifully written memoir. I cant wait for you all to read it! ❤️ #APromisedLand
ESTJ|So excited to see Kim Ng named the first woman and first Asian-American General Manager in the MLB. I grew up loving the Cubs, but I’ll be cheering you on! 
ESTJ|A huge congrats to Sydney Barber, who will be the first Black woman to lead Midshipmen at the U.S. Naval Academy. Your hard work—and the powerful example you set—are such an inspiration. I’m so proud of you! 
ESTJ|While working on Joining Forces, @DrBiden and I were honored to meet with our extraordinary troops, veterans and military families. This Veterans Day, take a moment to thank a military service member or veteran for their service and sacrifice to our country. 
ESTJ|Van, thank you for expressing the sorrow and relief that we all feel. My hope is that those who hoped for a different outcome will take a moment to empathize with the pain so many of us have felt over the past four years. 
ESTJ|My warmest congratulations again to Joe and Jill, Kamala and Doug—and each of you who stepped up when your country needed you.
ESTJ|We’ve got to promise each other that our focus in this election won’t be an anomaly, but the rule. That’s how we can not only feel this way right now, but in the months and years ahead. It’s the only way we’ll build a nation worthy of our children.
ESTJ|So it’s up to us to stay engaged and informed, to keep speaking out and marching on. We’ve got to vote in even greater numbers in the upcoming Senate runoffs in Georgia—and every state and local election going forward.
ESTJ|We see now the reality that we can’t take even the tiniest part of our democracy for granted. Every single vote must count — and every single one of us must vote. And as a country, we should be making it easier, not harder to cast a ballot.
ESTJ|But we’ve also got to recognize that the path to progress will always be uphill. We’ll always have to scrape and crawl up toward that mountaintop. And two years from now, four years from now, there will once again be no margin for error.
ESTJ|Let’s remember that tens of millions of people voted for the status quo, even when it meant supporting lies, hate, chaos, and division. We’ve got a lot of work to do to reach out to these folks in the years ahead and connect with them on what unites us.
ESTJ|And after we celebrate — and we should all take a moment to exhale after everything we’ve been through — let’s remember that this is just a beginning. It’s a first step. Voting in one election isn’t a magic wand, and neither is winning one.
ESTJ|Thank you to all of you who poured every ounce of your hope and determination into this democracy over these past four years, registering voters, getting them to the polls, keeping folks informed. More votes were cast in this election than ever before. It’s because of you.
ESTJ|I’m beyond thrilled that my friend @JoeBiden and our first Black and Indian-American woman Vice President, @KamalaHarris, are headed to restore some dignity, competence, and heart at the White House. Our country sorely needs it. 
ESTJ|There’s still time to vote! Look up your polling location at and head there now. #Vote
ESTJ|I see you, Chicago! Dont let anything get in your way of voting today. Check-in with your friends and loved ones and find your polling place at 
ESTJ|Use your voice and look out for one another today – were all in this together. ❤️
ESTJ|TODAY is Election Day. There are no do overs. Show up, have your voice heard, and vote. 
ESTJ|Is there someone in your life who you think might not vote? Call them right now and get them to the polls!
ESTJ|It’s time to vote, everybody! Polls are now open in many states. What time are you voting? Who are you bringing with you? #ElectionDay
ESTJ|I know Joe. He has lived his life guided by values and principles that mirror ones that most Americans can recognize. He understands the struggles of everyday folks. Vote today for the future you want to see for our country. Vote for @JoeBiden. 
ESTJ|It’s #ElectionDay! Wear a mask, thank your poll workers, and make your voice heard. If you have any questions or concerns while voting today, give the Election Protection Hotline a call at 1-866-687-8683. #WhenWeAllVote 
ESTJ|It’s been a tough year, a tough four years. But we are still here. If you know anyone who might not vote, give them a call right now! And do whatever it takes to get them to the polls tomorrow. Let’s go. It all comes down to tomorrow. ❤️💪🏿❤️ 
ESTJ|If you haven’t already, now is the time to vote! I put together some songs to help inspire you while you’re making your voice heard. And make sure all your loved ones have a plan to vote tomorrow. @WhenWeAllVote can help you find your polling place at

ESTJ|I could not be prouder of all the first-time voters out there, including @KingJames’ mom! There is too much at stake to sit this one out. Make your plan to vote right now 
ESTJ|It’s not too late to make your voice heard. You can still register in some states. And everyone can cast their ballot from now until Tuesday, November 3rd, the last day to vote. Make your plan to vote on #ElectionDay at 
ESTJ|Jill and I have done a lot of work with veterans and military families together over the years. Her experience as a military mom was at the heart and soul of that work. The Bidens know the sacred obligation we have to our heroic men and women in uniform—because theyve lived it.
ESTJ|There is no limit to what we, as women, can accomplish when we use our voices and vote. With only days left before the election, we have to keep showing up in numbers that cant be denied and voting like our lives depend on it. Vote for Joe and Kamala. 
ESTJ|Be like @LinManuel and vote early! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
ESTJ|With the election almost here, Ive been thinking a lot about one of the most important lessons that my parents taught Craig and me—to take responsibility for ourselves on everything from education to voting. Please, please vote by Tuesday, everybody. 
ESTJ|To all the young people out there I want you to know that you matter. Keep speaking up, keep marching for what you believe in, and most of all, keep voting. Youve already shown us what is possible when you do, and youll continue to make our country better for it.
ESTJ|I had chills listening to this. Thank you to The Neelys for this powerful reminder to vote. For so many of us, it wasnt that long ago that not everyone had the right to do so — every vote and voice matters.
ESTJ|Thank you, Bruce. Lets vote like our lives depend on it. 
ESTJ|Before you cast your vote, make sure you do research to learn more about who and what is going to be on your ballot. @WhenWeAllVote can help you make a plan to vote and help you review a sample ballot at

ESTJ|If 60 minutes is too much for you, here’s a highly entertaining 30.
ESTJ|Tag three friends to join your #VotingSquad and remind them to make a plan to vote at 
ESTJ|This week, I joined millions of Americans and #IVoted early! If you haven’t already, dont wait even a minute to mail in your ballot — or you can drop it off at a ballot drop box or vote early in person. 
ESTJ|Your vote is your voice. And if you don’t use it, someone else will. So make sure your voice is heard in this election. Make a plan to vote and then remind three friends to do the same. You can get the information you need to get started at #VoteLoud 
ESTJ|Happy birthday, @KamalaHarris! Hope youre showered with love on your special day. The best way to celebrate Kamala is by making sure you’re registered and have a plan to vote at And once you do, share how you’re voting with us!
ESTJ|If you believe that America deserves better, vote for Joe and Kamala like your life depends on it. But don’t stop there — get everyone you know to vote for them, too. 
ESTJ|Here’s my full closing argument for Joe Biden. I hope you’ll share this, too. 
ESTJ|15 days. That’s all we’ve got. If you or someone you know is still deciding how or if you’re going to vote, I hope you’ll take a minute to watch and share my message. We’ve got to get everyone we know to vote for @JoeBiden in numbers that can’t be denied. 
ESTJ|Thank you to the cast and crew of The West Wing for supporting @WhenWeAllVote and reminding every single one of us to vote. You can watch the #WestWingSpecial now, and I hope you don’t stop there vote as early as you can and remind three friends to do it, too. 
ESTJ|I’d love to hear from you. How have you been taking care of your physical and mental health during this time? #SelfCareSunday
ESTJ|In the midst of everything going on, I hope you’re still finding some time to take care of yourself. Whether that’s unplugging for just a few minutes or going out for a socially-distanced walk––it’s so important to have a wellness routine that works for you. #MichelleObamaPodcast 
ESTJ|For eight years, @PeteSouza was there capturing every moment of Baracks time in office. I’m so grateful for his sharp eye—I hope you’ll watch @WayISeeItFilm tonight at 10pm ET on MSNBC and see why we need to vote for @JoeBiden like our lives depend on it. 
ESTJ|I’ll start I’m challenging these folks to create their #VotingSquad, make a plan to vote, and challenge three friends to do it, too. @chloexhalle @BigSean @jonasbrothers @fatjoe @llcoolj @YaraShahidi @HERMusicx @theebillyporter @jaytatum0 @IssaRae The cast of @insecurehbo
ESTJ|Making sure our friends and family have a plan to vote will make all the difference in this election. So here’s my challenge to you text three people in your life today and ask them to join your #VotingSquad and make a plan to vote. Join us 
ESTJ|What are some topics you’d like me to focus on for a future season or episode? Let me know in the replies and I’ll try to get back to you!
ESTJ|For my first season of The #MichelleObamaPodcast, I focused on the different kinds of relationships that make up our lives, speaking to some of my nearest and dearest in the process. And I love hearing about the conversations youve been having with loved ones after listening. 
ESTJ|We can’t let anyone sit this election out! Get your #VotingSquad together, make a plan to vote, and challenge three friends to do the same. I challenge my @WhenWeAllVote co-chairs to get their #VotingSquad and make a plan to vote. Join us 
ESTJ|On The International #DayoftheGirl, I’m celebrating the power and promise of young women around the world. Two years ago, we started the @GirlsAlliance to empower adolescent girls through education. Support this work in honor of a girl in your life today 
ESTJ|I grew up just a few miles away from where Pastor Tracey Lee is doing such incredible work. During a summer of heartbreaking loss, shes shown up day-in, day-out with faith and love, courage and compassion, and an unshakable belief in young peoples right to safety.
ESTJ|@TwitterWomen @girlsalliance @Malala In Vietnam last year, I spent some time with Yên, who wakes up before dawn to help her mom with the grocery store they run out of their home. Then she takes a bike and ferry to get to class. As she told me, I won’t give up on my education or on my dreams. She’s just amazing. 
ESTJ|@TwitterWomen @girlsalliance This week I teamed up with @Malala and Priya, a student from a @girlsalliance community in India, for a great conversation about the role education played in our lives and ways we can all support girls’ around the world. #DayOfTheGirl 
ESTJ|@TwitterWomen @girlsalliance Whenever I meet with girls around the world, I am always so awed by their determination and their promise—and I want them to have the same chances to chase their dreams as I’ve had. Educated girls can transform their families, their communities, and our whole world. #DayOfTheGirl
ESTJ|Strong. Honest. Clear. Hopeful. Tonight, @KamalaHarris proved that she and @JoeBiden have what it takes to move this country forward. And now it’s up to us to go vote for them. Vote early—do it as soon as you can, in person or by mail. Get started now at 
ESTJ|Good luck tonight, @KamalaHarris! You’ve got this. 💪🏾😷
ESTJ|Thanks for the podcast love, @dopelabspodcast! You’re doing such an amazing job of inspiring your listeners to love science. Keep it up, ladies! #MichelleObamaPodcast
ESTJ|#ImVotingFor the fundamental decency of Americans to be reflected in the Oval Office. Im voting for competence over chaos, for unity over division. Im voting for @JoeBiden because he can bring people together to make our country a whole lot better.
ESTJ|Getting an education past high school is still the best investment you can make for your future. Im so proud that @CommonApp made taking that step a little bit easier for young people, especially for students of color, by removing the school discipline question. #ReachHigher
ESTJ|And more than anything, I hope you’ll vote for Joe with power, with passion, and with a love of this country that cannot possibly be denied.
ESTJ|So I hope you’ll watch, and I hope you’ll share this with everyone you know who might still be deciding how or if they’re going to vote.
ESTJ|There’s only one way we can pull ourselves out—by voting for my friend @JoeBiden, who’s got the heart, the experience, and the character to lead us to better days.
ESTJ|Because the drama of the past few days has only emphasized what’s at stake in this election, from the coronavirus to a constant drumbeat of fear, division, and chaos that’s threatening to spiral out of control.
ESTJ|And I’ll be very honest This is a message I’d planned to release earlier, and after everything that’s happened, I weighed whether or not to go public at all. But I wanted you all to hear what’s been on my mind.
ESTJ|The truth is, the events of the past few days are a bracing reminder of the tragedy that has been this administration’s response to this crisis.
ESTJ|My heart goes out to everyone touched by this virus, from those at the White House, especially the Secret Service and residence staff whose service ought never be taken for granted, to all those names and stories most of us will unfortunately never know. 
ESTJ|There are remarkable organizations all over the world working to ensure girls keep learning safely during the pandemic. As we gear up for the International #DayoftheGirl this week, I hope you’ll support this critical work through the @GirlsAlliance 
ESTJ|Ahead of the #DayoftheGirl, I teamed up with @Malala and Priya Mondol from the @GirlsAlliance community for a conversation about an issue close to our hearts girls education around the world. 
ESTJ|Thank you, Mayor @KeishaBottoms! This is such a critical step for making sure elections in Atlanta can run safely and securely. Mayors and local leaders have the power to step up and do this across the country, and I hope they do.
ESTJ|Tune in to my episode on the @RachaelRayShow 
ESTJ|Rachael asked me what’s keeping me up at night, and here’s what I told her It’s the idea that after all the fear and division and chaos, this president could still get four more years. The choice couldn’t be clearer––weve got to vote for @JoeBiden like our lives depend on it. 
ESTJ|Look, I understand why people are cynical right now. I talked with Conan about what it feels like to be a mother and a person of color in this moment—and how if we want to hope for some change on any of the issues we care about, then weve got to vote for @JoeBiden.
ESTJ|Make sure they know how and when they’re going to vote. And then follow up with them, every day, to make sure they cast their ballot. Because in this election, we’ve got to vote for Joe in numbers that cannot be denied. 
ESTJ|It’s the only way we can get out of this chaos and restore some stability to this country. You can start by reaching out to everyone you know. Make sure they’re registered.
ESTJ|If you were turned off by the President’s behavior last night, I feel you. Believe me, I do. But we can’t let him win by tuning out altogether. That’s what he wants. So turn those feelings into action—turn them into votes for my friend, @JoeBiden.

ESTJ|We saw it again on Tuesday—too many communities are being targeted and silenced by voter suppression. I believe every voice must be heard in every election—and that’s what @WhenWeAllVote is fighting for. But we need your help 
ESTJ|This past month has shown that you all know how to make your voices heard. Now its time to speak out at the ballot box. You can vote today in Georgia, North Dakota, South Carolina, West Virginia , Nevada. Dont miss this chance to have a say in the future of your communities.
ESTJ|#Classof2020, and every one of you out there using your voice to fight for justice, you all are exactly what we need right now—and for the years and decades to come. I love you all. I believe in you all. This is your time. @reachhigher
ESTJ|This is how you can finish the work that the generations before you started. By staying open and hopeful, even through tough times. Even through discomfort and pain. Channel your feelings into activism and into this democracy that was designed to respond to those who vote.
ESTJ|Text everybody you know to join you in exercising their constitutional right to protest. Send all your friends a link to register to vote at And show up to vote in every election.
ESTJ|So if you’re spending a lot of time hashtagging and posting right now, that’s useful, especially during a pandemic. But it’s only a beginning. Go further.
ESTJ|And if you hold strong with the same faith that carried all those giants before you toward real, measurable progress—you will change the course of history.
ESTJ|Dr. King was angry. Sojourner Truth was angry. Lucretia Mott, Cesar Chavez, the folks at Stonewall—they were all angry. But they were also driven by compassion, by principle—by hope.
ESTJ|To anyone who’s feeling invisible Know that your story matters. Your ideas, your experiences, your vision for our world all matter. Your anger—that matters too. But left on its own, it will only corrode, destroy, and sow chaos—on the inside and out.
ESTJ|So much has changed so quickly. And if any of you are confused or scared or angry—or just plain overwhelmed—I just want you to know that you aren’t alone. I am feeling all that, too. And I have a few things I want to say about it. 
ESTJ|As @aliciakeys communicates so beautifully here, like so many of you, I’ve been doing a lot of thinking over the past few weeks. I tried to put words to what I’m feeling about this moment, how we got here, and where we’re headed. I hope you’ll join us 
ESTJ|It ends with justice, compassion, and empathy that manifests in our lives and on our streets. I pray we all have the strength for that journey, just as I pray for the souls and the families of those who were taken from us.
ESTJ|It’s up to all of us—Black, white, everyone—no matter how well-meaning we think we might be, to do the honest, uncomfortable work of rooting it out. It starts with self-examination and listening to those whose lives are different from our own.
ESTJ|Race and racism is a reality that so many of us grow up learning to just deal with. But if we ever hope to move past it, it can’t just be on people of color to deal with it.
ESTJ|Like so many of you, I’m pained by these recent tragedies. And I’m exhausted by a heartbreak that never seems to stop. Right now it’s George, Breonna, and Ahmaud. Before that it was Eric, Sandra, and Michael. It just goes on, and on, and on. 
ESTJ|Last year, I celebrated 50 years of Sesame Street with Big Bird, Grover, and the whole gang. This year, I am as proud as ever of @SesameWorkshop, especially as they provide new resources for families looking to encourage learning from home.

ESTJ|Marriage is a choice you make every day. It can be hard work, but when two people commit to seeing that work through, the rewards are as sweet as they come. Congratulations Marlo and Phil! You two show us how it’s done. 💘
ESTJ|Looking forward to joining this incredible lineup with @ReachHigher on June 6th. Get ready to celebrate, #ClassOf2020! 🎓👏🏾

ESTJ|So many mothers are working tirelessly to get their families, workplaces, communities––and themselves––through this difficult time. They are heroes, and we should honor them today––and every day. From my family to yours, #HappyMothersDay.

ESTJ|No American should have to choose between making their voice heard and staying safe. Expanding access to #VoteByMail, online voter registration and early voting are critical steps for this moment—they’re also long overdue.
ESTJ|Today, Wisconsin voters had to choose between making their voice heard and keeping themselves and their family safe. No American should ever have to make that choice. We must do better to ensure voting is safe for all voters. The latest Wisconsin voting information is below.
ESTJ|On this #WorldHealthDay, I want to thank all the healthcare workers on the frontlines who have been risking their lives for us. I hope you’ll join me in expressing gratitude to the healthcare workers in your life. Lets show them how appreciated they are!

ESTJ|We could all use #SomeGoodNews. I couldn’t help but smile after watching this video with @johnkrasinski, @LinManuel, and the cast of @HamiltonMusical surprising a young fan, giving us all a little bit of joy at this difficult time.
ESTJ|Anyone who can stay home should absolutely do so. From medical professionals to grocery store clerks, our frontline workers continue to risk their lives for us, so let’s do our part by staying home for them. #StayAtHome
ESTJ|Bill Withers made the sort of music that you couldn’t help but sing along to—from Lean on Me to Lovely Day, he had a gift for giving voice to our joys and our sorrows. Truly one of the greats. Barack and I send love and prayers to his family and friends. He will be missed.
ESTJ|.@KerryWashington is right. The first few days of each month are crucial for families that depend on WIC products. Let’s look out for each other by taking the extra few seconds to look at those labels. Every act of kindness counts. ❤️
ESTJ|If you’re feeling as grateful to––and in awe of––our first responders as I am, now is the time to let them know. A handwritten letter, a social media post, or a simple thank you text can go a long way in showing our appreciation for these heroes among us.

ESTJ|Thank you, Chicago! To everyone who came out to our events — the students, the Girl Scouts, the moms and daughters and, as Oprah said, all those woke men — thank you for beginning this journey with me. #IAmBecoming 
ESTJ|I love this! We all need a little more kindness in our lives. #IAmBecoming
ESTJ|This makes me smile, Sammy. Thank you for sharing. #IAmBecoming
ESTJ|So glad you all had some fun. Keep reaching for your dreams, ladies! #IAmBecoming
ESTJ|My heart is with everyone affected by the devastating fires in California—the brave first responders, those who’ve lost loved ones or homes, and many others. Let’s all do our part to support these families. It’s who we are.
ESTJ|It seems like yesterday that @BarackObama and I were taking our girls to @57thstreetbooks store. Today, I was there with a book of my own. Thanks to everyone who braved the cold and stopped by. #IAmBecoming 
ESTJ|Chicago made me who I am. I wanted to pay tribute to the South Side community that poured so much love into me from the very beginning, so I wrote this letter to the @ChiDefender. I hope you’ll read it #IAmBecoming 
ESTJ|Hey Chicago! I’m so excited to be in my hometown to kick off my #IAmBecoming tour! This memoir has helped me to embrace the fullness of my story—failures, triumphs, and all. I hope it inspires you to do the same. Who are you becoming? Share your story with #IAmBecoming. 
ESTJ|Thank you, Oprah! I’ve been so grateful for your friendship and advice for so long. And now I’m honored to join your amazing book club! #IAmBecoming
ESTJ|The service, strength, and resilience of our veterans and their families is one of the great inspirations in my life. As we observe #VeteransDay18, let’s all recommit to serving them as well as they’ve served us.

ESTJ|Have you voted? There’s still time to get to the polls. Dont sit this one out and hand over important decisions that affect your life to someone else. If you’ve already voted, check in with your friends and family to make sure they’ve voted, too! #VoteToday #WhenWeAllVote

ESTJ|The Global @GirlsAlliance is proud to support grassroots leaders whose work is helping girls around the world fulfill their potential. These leaders need our help. So I hope you’ll read their stories, learn about their work, and support them however you can at @GoFundMe.
ESTJ|An educated girl can lift up her family, her community, and her country. That’s why I’m so proud that today the @ObamaFoundation is launching the Global @GirlsAlliance in support of adolescent girls education around the world. Join us 
ESTJ|There are few things that inspire me like seeing the potential of adolescent girls around the world. Today, on International #DayoftheGirl, I’ll be on the @TodayShow to discuss the ways we can help adolescent girls get the education they deserve. I hope you’ll join me.
ESTJ|#WhenWeAllVote, we get a little respect. So I hope you’ll go to or text WeAllVote to 97779 to register right now. Then help your friends do the same.
ESTJ|Thank you @barackobama for 26+ years of love, trust, and respect - for being a man who always lifts up and honors me and our wonderful girls. Each day I’m with you, I’m reminded of what a treasure you truly are to us all.
ESTJ|That was fun, Miami! Thank you for everything you’ve done to make the @WhenWeAllVote Week of Action a success. Now let’s get out there and make sure that everyone we know votes in November for something they believe in. Text WeAllVote to 97779 or visit 
ESTJ|Now’s the time to channel all your energy and emotion into getting fired up for Election Day—and I’m excited to be in Miami with @WhenWeAllVote to do just that! Join us live at 
ESTJ|.@ReachHigher was an initiative borne from my own experience—the idea that an education opens up doors that are otherwise closed for kids like me. I’m thrilled that thanks to @CommonApps commitment to those same values, that message will thrive for years to come. #ReachHigher
ESTJ|Theres a lot at stake this November. If we stay home, critical issues that affect our families and communities get ignored. Today on #NationalVoterRegistrationDay, register to vote and then get to the polls on Nov. 6. Text WeAllVote to 97779 to get started. #WhenWeAllVote 
ESTJ|Thank you, Las Vegas! Now let’s get working to help our family and friends get registered to vote. Text WeAllVote to 97779 or head to to get started.

ESTJ|Truly humbled by the response to my upcoming book tour. I can’t wait to share BECOMING with all of you , hope to see you somewhere along the way! 
ESTJ|When I was younger, thinking about going to college sometimes gave me a pit in my stomach. I came from a working-class family. I was young, black, and female. Of course I doubted myself. But I didn’t let those fears win. #BetterMakeRoom
ESTJ|I’m done with my book! I’ve learned a lot about myself and I’d like to share my story of BECOMING—the plainness, the blemishes, the crazy turns—with you on my book tour, beginning 11/13 in Chicago. Go to to find out how to get tickets. #IAmBecoming 
ESTJ|As you start this new school year, I want you to strive to work harder than ever before, challenge yourself to reach new heights, and seek opportunities that will help you grow. I believe in you! #BetterMakeRoom
ESTJ|We can each do our part to help all eligible voters make their voices heard in this upcoming election and every election. And Im thrilled that companies like @Lyft are working with @WhenWeAllVote to get people registered , out to vote this November.
ESTJ|My father taught me that voting is a sacred responsibility, one that none of us can take for granted. And #WhenWeAllVote, we can make our voices heard. Join me and @WhenWeAllVote for a Week of Action this September to get fired up for Election Day 
ESTJ|Watching Aretha Franklin perform at the White House, and on so many other occasions, made time stand still. @BarackObama and I are holding Aretha’s family in our hearts right now. She will forever be our Queen of Soul. 
ESTJ|The Voting Rights Act makes our democracy stronger, giving every American, from all walks of life, the right to vote. But the work is far from finished. Join me and @WhenWeAllVote for a Week of Action to get folks registered and ready to spread the word. 
ESTJ|Happy birthday @BarackObama! The view is always better with you. 
ESTJ|.@BarackObama and I are so proud of @KingJames and @IPROMISESchool. Kids in Akron and across the US are lucky to have you as a role model on and off the court. Keep using your platform for good and giving our kids a chance to shoot for the stars. 🌟🏀 #ReachHigher #BetterMakeRoom 
ESTJ|In my family, voting was a sacred responsibility, one which we never took for granted. I’m excited to be a part of @WhenWeAllVote to inspire and empower all eligible voters to make their voices heard. #WhenWeAllVote, we can make history. 
ESTJ|Passionate, committed young leaders like these are the key to Africa’s future and to the future of our world. Barack and I are so proud of them! 
ESTJ|Sometimes truth transcends party. 
ESTJ|To the first-gen students I met in DC yesterday, and those across the country, I want you to know that I’m so proud of you. This is only the beginning of what you will achieve! #BetterMakeRoom #FBF 
ESTJ|First-gen students are resilient, hardworking , determined. As a first-gen myself, I know the challenges many students face on their journey through college. On Thursday, Ill be taking your questions about college-submit them using #BetterMakeRoom. Can’t wait to hear from you! 
ESTJ|As I prepare to share BECOMING this fall, I hope you’ll also think about your own story, and trust that it will help you become whoever you aspire to be. Your story is what you have, what you will always have. It is something to own. #BECOMING 
ESTJ|I’m so inspired by the young people I met today from the South Side of Chicago, my hometown and the future site of the Obama Presidential Center. These high school seniors have big plans for college and beyond and I’m so proud of each and every one of them. 
ESTJ|It’s impossible for any picture to truly capture what my mother, Marian, has meant to me. Happy #MothersDay to all of the moms out there, and especially to my own. 
ESTJ|Thank you to the fierce and fearless @valeriejarrett, @tinatchen and @USOWomen for bringing together a crowd of thousands to reflect on the #StateofWomen, and for inspiring the next generation of leaders. #USOW2018

ESTJ|On May 2, I cant wait to celebrate my 5th #CollegeSigningDay in Philly! It’s been amazing seeing this event grow into a nationwide movement where schools and communities celebrate students for committing to a higher education. #FlashbackFriday @BetterMakeRoom 
ESTJ|Im so happy for my friend @chefsamkass whose new book shares healthy tips , delicious recipes my family has enjoyed for years. From launching the White House Kitchen Garden back in 2009 to becoming a successful entrepreneur , author, @barackobama and I couldn’t be prouder! 
ESTJ|Barack and I are thrilled to congratulate The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on their newest arrival! We hope to meet him soon for a Kensington Palace pajama party. I’ll wear my robe! 
ESTJ|Im so in awe of college-bound students all over the country—you inspire @BarackObama and me every day. We know how hard you’ve worked to make your college dreams a reality. That’s why #CollegeSigningDay is one of my favorite traditions. I can’t wait to celebrate in Philly!

Shooting these performances with Vevo was a really special experience. I was able to go back to the place where I made the music, an area of California I adore and have spent a lot of time in over my career.

All 10 songs have their special meanings to me and I hope they can all have meaning in your lives. I made a ten track album so hopefully you get to the end and want to go straight back to the start and do it all over again. I haven’t said much on this topic because I’ve been so overwhelmed and in a state of shock at the response to it. The Show Live On Tour 2024 is going to be amazing. Thank you all so much for getting tickets and wanting to be a part of this era. So many of the shows are already sold out but you can still get tickets for some shows now.

ESTP|@madoreslou I’ve found previously that I’ve got so engrossed in music that it gets worse the longer I spend at it ( in weeks ) 😂😂. So I’ve kinda taken it incrementally and done it in chunks of time and then taking time away from it and thinking
ESTP|@bluebirdhoney28 @smalltaIknh I should post a playlist . Let get into that

ESTP|Cmonnnnnnnn!!!!! ☘️ ☘️☘️☘️
ESTP|Yesssssssss!!! First Irish woman to win on @LPGA . Couldn’t be prouder of you Leona. Incredible performance. @leonamaguire @modestgolf @KPMGIreland @DavyGroup @KineticaSports @Kastus @PingTour
ESTP|Cmon @leonamaguire !! Nearly there. This would be incredible❤️ @LPGA
ESTP|@namj00nsfriend Hopefully haven’t even started yet
ESTP|@rejectara Yeh I just got them . Game changer
ESTP|@Lostlnamoment @RikkeS88 No . I just brush my teeth after I eat
ESTP|Congrats @RamsNFL !! A home super bowl in LA. Beautiful
ESTP|@jonnyh16 Want an explanation ?
ESTP|@mrewanmurray 😂😂
ESTP|@mrewanmurray none of your business
ESTP|Tears roll down my face with pride . WE ARE DERBY 🐏
ESTP|Forever and ever
ESTP|My Rams 🐏
ESTP|Great shot @TyrrellHatton ! Looking forward to watching the @SlyncDDC this weekend. @DPWorldTour
ESTP|@CoulsonMc Massive difference between losing in a play off semi final and losing a club
ESTP|Thanks @TaylorMadeTour for supporting Marcus ! @MHelligkilde
ESTP|@jonathanpric3 There some level of shite talk that . Grow up
ESTP|@CoulsonMc Fair enough but no one likes seeing other football clubs in this level of shit .
ESTP|@Higginbotham05 @dcfcofficial Hopefully, Danny. All of this should not be taken out on the fans of one of the oldest clubs in English history
ESTP|@Higginbotham05 @dcfcofficial Indeed mate ! 99 I think .
ESTP|@NeilGJones I’ll try my best for ya mate.
ESTP|@flickerniall13 Nope
ESTP|@Higginbotham05 @dcfcofficial First day of the season. Always got the goalkeeper kit on the first day of the season ( cheekily )
ESTP|I struggle to think about what my dad will do without Derby County. He lived his whole life providing for us and making sure he had enough on the side to get to Derby for the games. He will be absolutely heartbroken and lost without our beloved.
ESTP|@dcfcofficial 6 maybe
ESTP|@dcfcofficial Stood there in awe every week of the players, the ground, the noise of the fans, the songs we would sing. As a 7/8 year old I would be screaming at the top of my lungs and thought I was 35. I thought I was one of the lads for the day. Get on the train at 515 and do it all again
ESTP|@dcfcofficial after been up all night with excitement. having driven to Dublin, got the ferry to Holyhead at 5am, train to Crewe and change for derby. I would sprint through that turnstile if it let me. Down the steps and straight pitch side .
ESTP|@dcfcofficial Like this lad. 
ESTP|@CKirkbright I wish I was as cool as you.
ESTP|I echo what I said last week. We have seen it happen to one too many clubs and towns over the years and it can’t happen again.
ESTP|@Twitter @TwitterMusic Thank you twitter! This is really cool
ESTP|@EmilyAlexandraL Write your thoughts or a story from start to finish. I often think about stories as movies. There might need to be a twist in the bridge to make a mundane story more interesting. when ya watch a movie, once you’ve learned of the characters and the plot, there’s usually a twist
ESTP|@derbyteesniall I don’t know where it is 😂
ESTP|Amazing to be there to see the @Lakers win tonight!!
ESTP|@hellolovernjh @paperhousesxxx No I wouldn’t expect it in those months . I’m trying to get it all right 👍
ESTP|@flickeroflover Heyyy
ESTP|@italyrrylwt Yes but there also might be no such thing as derby county ever again if someone doesn’t buy us
ESTP|God only knows what’s next for us as a club but this club and it’s incredible support does not deserve to be in the hole we are in. we’ve seen it happen too many times to great clubs and it can’t happen again. We are derby county and we’ll fight to the end. #COYR 🐏
ESTP|The shift that Wayne, his staff and players are putting in during an awful period in the clubs history , is just astonishing. Every time we get knocked back, the boys put in performances like they did today.
ESTP|There are towns up and down the country that live for their football on a Saturday and Derby is well and truly one of them. A working class town with a solid football club since 1884. I have been a derby fan since I can remember and I’ve never been prouder to be.
ESTP|A big football club with a proper history, Premier league level stadium, huge and loyal support and an amazing training facility there for the taking. Let’s hope the administrators can figure something out very soon. Wouldn’t be able to handle losing our @dcfcofficial 🐏
ESTP|Excited to confirm our team at @modestsport will be working with @TheMarqueGlobal. Excited to get to work ! 
ESTP|@SwimmerRoss Oh yeh he’s going to run it as a sustainable for a FEW YEARS and just leave is he ? Ask Newcastle fans what a few years looks like
ESTP|@TeleFootball @JPercyTelegraph If the administrators accept his bid, it is based only on proof of funds and nothing else.
ESTP|Please no!
ESTP|Derby County 🐏❤️
ESTP|I know I’m late but … Happy New Year guys ❤️. Let’s make it a good one xx
ESTP|Happy Christmas everyone !! Love you all ❤️
ESTP|@strrydress @markmac14 ✒️
ESTP|Amazing line up of Irish talent streaming from at 8pm tomorrow. Ill be tuning in. Good work @OtherVoicesLive, @homeofguinness, @GoToIreland #OVHome

ESTP|I hope you all enjoy it, but above all, I hope it lets anyone who might be struggling right now know that we are here for them. Special thank you to @edsheeran, @LewisCapaldi, @yungblud, @samsmith and @wiffygriffy for being a part of this video. 
ESTP|I love being a part of @bbccin. We’ve worked closely over the past decade and I want to continue to help where I can, and given what we have all been through over the last year and a half, it feels more important than ever.

ESTP|@Thnkful4Nialler I’m in the studio. I’m not going anywhere near the road just yet
ESTP|@flickerofgold General obviously😂😂. You guuuyyyyssss
ESTP|@helloxpetal Knowing that you love the songs and then hoping that the masses feel the same .It’s the worst feeling
ESTP|@helloxpetal Getting the uptempo songs to match the type of things I want to write about
ESTP|@StillAllyBrooke Why who’s that ? Hahahaha
ESTP|@solonghbw Oh yeah
ESTP|@thehorantour BODE
ESTP|@ohdearpatience No. Shite
ESTP|@NHFLOOF1 No
ESTP|@niallstillya The whole thing was amazing ! The crowds in Mexico are always brilliant .
ESTP|@bynewangel A touch yeh
ESTP|@tosanfranciscc No better feeling . Especially on tour. I get too nervous for tv performances etc. I sometimes think I wish they’d filmed the soundcheck 😂
ESTP|@halluciniallh If I could sell that amount of tickets, I’d play as many shows as possible
ESTP|@tosanfranciscc Yes
ESTP|@i84HBW Modelo . No competition
ESTP|@flickerofgold I would love to but some cities won’t get the songs they see from previous shows and so on
ESTP|@vaneccx @lauraletitiaxo No not yet
ESTP|@nhnoel7 It’s all really nice to wear
ESTP|@lauraletitiaxo Yeh go ahead . Make a ten song set list . New album obviously makes up the rest. Whatever that number ends up being, I don’t know.
ESTP|@Lostlnamoment @Thnkful4Nialler 😂😂
ESTP|@91ftdtluvbot Best thing I’ve ever seen
ESTP|@JulieLovesWind I’ll play golf with Tom whenever
ESTP|@Thnkful4Nialler Cmon now
ESTP|@newangeltay So do I !
ESTP|Love you ❤️
ESTP|@horanswangel Trying to write great songs and then tour the shit out of it in big venues. Gotta try my best
ESTP|@horansrep Eagles the other night was the best I’ve seen them , that I can remember clearly
ESTP|@sxnflowrlou I guess so .It’s nice . It’s all about the tunes . All about the tunes
ESTP|@goldenxIou Still want to do that .Selling arenas is next on the agenda
ESTP|@bndtherules Would love to see Jackson Browne live. Haven’t seen Bob Dylan .
ESTP|@helloxpetal We’re just SHOPAHOLICS
ESTP|@RikkeS88 Sam fender, phoebe Bridgers , Bon iver
ESTP|@bealrightnjh @niallernroses My first concert was an eagles concert when I was 4 or 5 . I see them up there and I’m like I want to do that .
ESTP|@niallernroses Music does something to me that I can’t describe. I understand what goes into making a show and how hard it is. So when I go to a show I’m completely into it. Can barely talk to the people I’m with. Gotta watch every part
ESTP|@krutilovesnjh You may hear it
ESTP|@horansalbum If I thought it was good enough, I would
ESTP|@niallhenergy No no ! Miles off that stuff
ESTP|@lyricallwt Yes
ESTP|@swtlawley Yeh there’s already a few I can picture live . Can’t wait
ESTP|@Heatherey @LottexNiallH @sunxflickr Axel arigato
ESTP|@horansalbum Kinda
ESTP|@sunxflickr I’d just had a filling in my tooth ,walked out in to the street with a numb mouth and a pap came sprinting at me 😂😂😂
ESTP|@nhpallom Yeah for sure
ESTP|@NiallStyleNJH me and lewis went shopping. I bought a candle 😂
ESTP|@helloxpetal 100% !!! I’ve learned a lot about myself in the last couple years. I think you’ll hear it in the music
ESTP|@stniall91 When the album went number 1 . When slow hands went number 1 worldwide 🤯. The whole tour obviously.
ESTP|@niallernroses I’ve no idea. There’s always lines written down or ideas.
ESTP|@njhftdolans I wish 😂😂😂
ESTP|@njhdenise @solonghbw I loved my time at the Ryman . Of course I’d love to play it again. I would however prefer to play bridgestone arena now.
ESTP|@niallsthighs Not this time, no. He’s gotta look after that beautiful voice
ESTP|@LottexNiallH @solonghbw Yeh
ESTP|@fllckrvol6 @solonghbw 22 or 23 don’t know yet but yes ….. let’s make it happen
ESTP|@ashleyft1d I’m sure some of it will be in the next set list. whenever that may be
ESTP|@solonghbw I’d like to be on stage at ……. Madison square garden or the O2 . Something like that
ESTP|4 years of Flicker !! Thank you for everything you did with this album. It was an amazing record to write, loved touring it and seeing you beautiful people around the world.
ESTP|@adnarry Yes
ESTP|@cuteniallbaby No . I’m still writing. I want it to be the best I can possibly make it , so it’s not done til I feel that way
ESTP|@helloxpetal Bit of both
ESTP|@stillpatience No but there are some topics that appear a couple of times
ESTP|@eslwt91 No real connection
ESTP|@xojaanae Loving life
ESTP|@niaIIskiwi Yeh this is my favourite for sure
ESTP|@flickerofgold Yeh I think so
ESTP|@horanandbirrita Yep
ESTP|@Niallisanpotato @NiallStyleNJH A good mix as always .
ESTP|@NiallStyleNJH Not sure . If I get the album done in time , I will .
ESTP|@Sraadmi Yes i love it … getting there slowly
ESTP|@pinkbluelou 505
ESTP|@dreamoodon Ok…. Goodnight
ESTP|@alwayshaIo In the studio
ESTP|@loveonmeg I would love nothing more but …. Not just yet
ESTP|Hello lovers
ESTP|I think we all know the answer to this.
ESTP|@samfendermusic @ladbible 😂😂😂 If derby were bought out like that, I’d disappear for weeks
ESTP|@GirafaGitana Signing Marcus is big for us. He is a great guy and a hell of a player. Can’t wait for next season already
ESTP|@ladbible 😂😂😂😂 go on sammy fender
ESTP|@thislovesm @ShawnMendes Correct 😂
ESTP|@ShawnMendes Let’s try 😂😂. trying would be a lot more than we’ve done previously
ESTP|@ShawnMendes Agreed ❤️
ESTP|Loved watching the @dunhilllinks these last couple of days! Best of luck to the @modestgolf lads over the weekend @TyrrellHatton @guidomigliozzi @EwboF @connorsyme
ESTP|@ashemusic Oh tell me about it. Been tryna beat it since the day I wrote it 😂😂
ESTP|Great round @EwboF ! @modestgolf @dunhilllinks
ESTP|@rioferdy5 @dcfcofficial 😂
ESTP|@rioferdy5 @dcfcofficial Wazza at the wheel
ESTP|I see all the love for ‘This Town’ today on its 5 year anniversary. Thank you for all the support over the years, you’ve no idea how much it means to me. I’m working on the next chapter and hope it will be the best one yet ❤️
ESTP|Yessssss T . Love it ❤️
ESTP|Heartbreaking
ESTP|@rickygervais That’s the dream ❤️❤️❤️
ESTP|@dcfcofficial @WayneRooney ❤️❤️❤️
ESTP|@AnneMarie Cheers Poo head
ESTP|Cheers Jim . ❤️
ESTP|Thank you all for the lovely birthday wishes. Love you x ❤️
ESTP|@ellenspatience I don’t know actually . Next week maybe . I don’t know how the pros play 4 days in a row for their livelihood. I’m soo tired after one round 😂
ESTP|@cherryfIicker @flickerevans Tall grass is sooo tough . Turns your club face left . You need to swing hard to keep it straight
ESTP|@flickerofgold I caught that one quite well to be fair. Usually hit it 280 off the tee or so
ESTP|@EmilyAlexandraL Ahhh brilliant . That’s amazing
ESTP|@flickerevans Yes I was there in 2015, I think. Pga championship. Amazing course
ESTP|@nojudgemvnt To play golf you can’t grip too hard because it skews the club face. When you feel tense, you grip hard. When I see people in the crowd , I get tense because I don’t want to hit them. ( bare in mind when I usually play, there’s no one there )
ESTP|@dearpatiencie Bring a friend and go play . You can laugh at eachother 😂
ESTP|@vaneccx Well that picture is my least favourite. Missing 3 foot putts through lack of concentration and nerves
ESTP|@notstylesish In Ireland it’s a big sport
ESTP|@notstylesish 9 or 10 maybe
ESTP|@horantalk98 @sunxflickr @Bendtherulxs Clean it up for the next person that lands in there
ESTP|@nhpallom My inconsistent swing . When it feels natural it produces some good stuff and that’s why I’m able to keep my handicap down but every other swing I stand over it and feel like I’ve never played the game before . The ongoing battle of a golfer
ESTP|@sunxflickr @Bendtherulxs Yeh I don’t even look at the ball. I look an inch or so behind it and hit that
ESTP|@loveeforniall Augusta every single day
ESTP|@Bendtherulxs I love playing out of the sand to be honest . Most people don’t . Hit one bad one out of there yesterday because the sand was fluffy and i didn’t swing hard enough .
ESTP|@niallsperoni The whole damn thing
ESTP|@96flicker Royal portrush / augusta
ESTP|@bndrlsniall It’s the hardest sport ever 😂
ESTP|@curiouslyhoran 😂😂😂 the putter head is designed to stay perfectly balanced when swinging. So I rest it up there and it’s weighted perfectly
ESTP|@damnnviall @guidomigliozzi Champion . Greatest guy
ESTP|@derbyteesniall It was the hardest I’ve ever seen it . Joke . Soo firm and the rough was thicckkkkk and hard to hit out of.
ESTP|@good4niallh @OnTheLoose4NJH2 @BMWPGA Tom played in the morning, I played in the afternoon. Didn’t get to see him
ESTP|@OnTheLoose4NJH2 @BMWPGA To find a point on the ground to line it up to and I know if it rolls over that point and I’ve read the putt right, it will go in .
ESTP|@BMWPGA He came second in a clutch junior tournament last week. Smashed it
ESTP|@jadedgoingcrazy @TheSolheimCup Not too late. Go for it
ESTP|If you’re a young person looking for inspiration to get in to golf, turn your tv on now. @TheSolheimCup is incredible. ❤️
ESTP|❤️❤️
ESTP|Yesss @leonamaguire !! Unbelievable performance yet again. Proud is an understatement. @SolheimCupEuro
ESTP|@4EKAD4 @TheSolheimCup @SolheimCupEuro @leonamaguire Ladies golf is on fire right now . I’m delighted
ESTP|@4EKAD4 @TheSolheimCup @SolheimCupEuro @leonamaguire Woooohoooooo
ESTP|Glued to @TheSolheimCup . @SolheimCupEuro we are all rooting for ya. Let’s get it done, ladies. So proud of you @leonamaguire ❤️🇪🇺
ESTP|Thank you @PRGGolf !
ESTP|😂😂😂
ESTP|@hesscityangel Persistence . It can be a very frustrating game but so enjoyable
ESTP|@madoreslou Very very very far from it
ESTP|@jadedgoingcrazy Correct. That’s also another thing that makes me feel better 😂😂😂
ESTP|@flickerofgold I know I can play golf , some courses are not easy at all. Not even for the pros
ESTP|@derbyteesniall Feel the same about it every time I play it and I’m a member there . It’s one of the hardest courses there is. So just accept that it’s gona kick the shit out of me
ESTP|@91FALLINGHBW Do you honestly think I love social media so much that I have a burner account ?
ESTP|@stilltbsllou @betterotb What burner account ? 🤯😂
ESTP|@betterotb Huh???
ESTP|@vaneccx Studio week after next
ESTP|@niallsperoni Doing 0 . Nothing happening
ESTP|@tosanfranciscc I didn’t mean to … ya know me
ESTP|@tosanfranciscc Did it delete ? 😂😂
ESTP|@niallersmug Oh if Bobby Carlos wants to give me a shout , I’ll go drinking with him no problem 😂😂
ESTP|@utdmurtaza 😂😂😂 fair play
ESTP|Amazing !!! can’t wait to hear it for myself .
ESTP|Derby day. Cmon you rams 🐏 @dcfcofficial
ESTP|@glitzylwt @Cristiano I’m not saying anything . Haven’t a clue now. I thought it would be Chelsea but now I don’t know.
ESTP|He’s back !! It’s going to be so good to see him play in England again. @Cristiano ❤️
ESTP|Buzzing for @leonamaguire and the team !
ESTP|@GNev2 This is absolutely brilliant .
ESTP|@Y100MIAMI I say I can’t do it all 😂😂
ESTP|@ShawnMendes Hahahah. Maybe one day. If I’m doing a talk show full time, you know the music career hasn’t worked out and that’s not a good thing. 😂😂
ESTP|@ShawnMendes ya think you’re a coolie now don’t ya?
ESTP|@ingridhbw Little bit yes . I relaxed completely during Lizzo’s interview.
ESTP|@chaoticniall I wrote it with a couple of the writers
ESTP|@i6rudy No @EllieStidolph did 😂
ESTP|@pqllom I laughed the whole time . she was soooo funny
ESTP|@HBWCORBYN Loved doing the monologue.
ESTP|@horantalk98 Maybe. We’ll see if I get offered anything 😂
ESTP|@hbwhiddleston They did ? Hajahahah .
ESTP|@paperhousesxxx The experience was really cool. Working with writers, producers , a set , interviewing people for the first time basically. Lizzo and Cristo were brilliant
ESTP|@ohdearpatience Play golf, write songs, try and get in some sort of decent shape.
ESTP|@ohdearpatience Back to the studio
ESTP|@HBWBUCKY Yes, delighted . People seem to have enjoyed it

INFJ|Sci-fi that’s rooted in the possible near term future…both wonderful and terrifying. Check it out.
INFJ|New trailer drop👇🏼 I’m very proud to play a role in #Extrapolations. Scott Burns has always created great drama out of complicated social challenge , he’s done it again here. Like a ‘Black Mirror’ for environmental crisis! Physical danger, moral challenge , unexpected humor
INFJ|As @antonioguterres rightly says, we need disruption to end the climate destruction. ➡ No more baby steps. ➡ No more excuses. ➡ No more greenwashing. ➡ No more bottomless greed of the fossil fuel industry , its enablers. We need to #ActNow!

INFJ|This was such a privilege , a pleasure. I’ve admired Prof. Skip Gates for years as an Historian, a teacher, writer, conversationalist , I love this show. He’s an inspiration , this was full of revelations , his wonderful insight about life , how we are all connected to history.
INFJ|Well-spotted but our reference photo was actually this one 😘 (took a lot of tries to get that weird ‘crossed eye while trying to project seriousness’ just right!) 
INFJ|There is no airbrushing involved in a single one of these character posters

INFJ|And, 50 years after BMW built an electric concept car, it’s very exciting to see the transformational moment of transition from polluting ICE to EV’s finally encompass even iconic luxury muscle cars like the M-series.
INFJ|I had a great time collaborating on this green-themed campaign w @KITH , @RonnieFieg to raise support for a great org @MaasaiWild protecting biodiversity , critical forests. KITH made a generous contribution , committed 10% of their custom i4m50 auction 
INFJ|Enjoy a taste of Onion? Here it is. First tease. If you’re really into mystery maybe this and NO MORE!
INFJ|Hard agree.
INFJ|Listen, #GlassOnion ain’t my first rodeo when it comes to putting out a thriller, a mystery, a flick with a twist. So I won’t be the one who blows it by yakking to some flak. But if the boss @rianjohnson decides he’ll divulge a few things…well,okay 
INFJ|People who care about the super-heating of our country, drought, fire , all forms of climate catastrophe should pay attention to what ConocoPhillips is doing at Willow Creek. @POTUS has the power to stop this but so far, backtracking on even public input. 
INFJ|I’ll use any excuse to come to London…working on the score of Motherless Brooklyn w the great @DANIELPEMBERTON late nights down on Bermondsey , recording @ Abbey Rd was my last London bliss. Joining the @rianjohnson troupe was an equal joy , 👇🏼 will be a LOT of fun.
INFJ|If you have even a small bit of care for how our country treats veterans of our wars who suffered grievous harm to their health , urgently need our govt to make good on its basic commitments to them, please watch this. Or watch just to see Fat Wolverine lie through his teeth

INFJ|Toronto here we come 👇🏼 ❤️
INFJ|And he ended up such a memorable part of one of Spike’s best films. Baltimore legend, yes, but I’ll remember him even more for his huge warm spirit. The guy loved life and it rubbed off on you. Lucky to have crossed paths w him and shared a few minutes. RIP GOOSE!
INFJ|So sad to hear the news that we’ve lost Tony Siragusa. So many laughs on ‘25th Hour’, Goose always putting me , Spike Lee on the floor w his stories. ‘Fellas I hope you know what you’re doing here cause I sure don’t!’ But who else could deliver that much lovable muscle? ..1)
INFJ|If she were still with us, Agatha would have @rianjohnson kneel then she’d lower the Mystery Writer pen solemnly , tap him on each shoulder , name him one of the Knights of the craft. Then she’d settle back with her popcorn , watch #GlassOnion , cackle with delight
INFJ|Excited to share from Maestro @rianjohnson , without doubt one of the most hilarious , fantastic ensembles of actors I’ve ever been privileged to join - let the guessing game begin! #GlassOnion @KnivesOut @netflix (we finished filming last Sept , I still laugh thinking about it)
INFJ|👇🏼
INFJ|For those looking for a way to support families devastated by the Robb elementary school shooting in #Uvalde, Texas @gofundme has assembled a centralized hub for verified fundraisers. Donate directly to help the families of the victims here 
INFJ|Wow, this kid gets today’s prize for brilliance, heart , courage
INFJ|And worth mentioning the incredible documentary ‘Exterminate All the Brutes’ by Haitian filmmaker #RaoulPeck which is on HBO. Both the sordid French history in Haiti , the economic components of colonial genocide are brilliantly dissected in this emotional , personal film.
INFJ|👇🏼An excellent, balanced take on how it’s both highly laudable for @nytimes to spotlight the long tail effect of colonialism on poverty , also laughable to suggest that this exposé is novel or original. There were professors thoroughly unpacking most of this in at Yale in 1990.
INFJ|Fossil fuels are a dead end — environmentally and economically. Fully agree with @AntonioGuterres. The climate crisis is the fight of our lives, we don’t have a moment to lose. The only sustainable future is a renewable one! 
INFJ|This is really cool. Great opportunity to get any direct support to a Ukrainian family that you can manage immediately doubled.
INFJ|@pmarca I am so with this sentiment…but practically I think Google translate would have a rough time explaining jack-hammers, aircraft , pug dogs in Ancient Latin. And that Canada Goose isn’t a military unit. Hopefully after his first NY slice he’d ease up on the ‘Sorry…what is THAT?!’
INFJ|Unlike this judge who decided to condescendingly critique a piece of art he hadn’t even seen, our best writer ever from B-more @AoDespair clearly lives by Dylan’s line ‘I’ll know my song well before I start singing’. I guess we should thank Judge Bedar b/c he gave us this 🧵👇🏼🔥
INFJ|…not just for Russia but for all who are sick of the corruptions of greed , violence of power. He has a wife , children but like Mandela , Havel he refuses to capitulate to bullies. Solidarity w this man , support for this campaign should be a global commitment #freeNavalny
INFJ|There are real heroes in this world , they are not on movie screens. @navalny is a moral superhero. A hero of conscience , courage. He’s survived assassination attempts , sits in prison right now because he fights for truth , democracy… … 1)
INFJ|A great #EarthDay piece from my friends @UNEP from a wonderful day we spent together in the stunningly beautiful Amboseli National Park w the legendary Cynthia Moss @ElephantTrust @kwskenya , @magicalkenya
INFJ|We need to do much more , much faster. Its Earth Day. Please take the time to watch this. We cant create the collective political will necessary if a strong majority of us arent fully tuned in and up to speed on the urgency of the moment. This is THE challenge of our time.
INFJ|@Apple directed over 38,000 metric tons of e-waste to recycling globally in 2021. I had a phone , 2 iPads get fully destroyed recently (dont ask how 🤦‍♂️Friends @Apple sent me info on how to recycle. You often get credit too. Please share. Here it is 
INFJ|Happy Earth Day🌎Cool idea #1 Did you know you can recycle most @Apple products? iPhones contain finite resources like steel, tungsten , more. A robot named Daisy can strip out these rare-earth minerals , recover materials from 23 different iPhones at rate of 200 devices / hour. 
INFJ|Staggeringly offensive. A federal judge calls this company ‘an ongoing menace to society’ , yet @NRDC, backed by well-meaning but ill-informed donors, stays dedicated to its role as policy , press arm of this antiquated energy cartel, trying to kill shift to distributed energy 🤦🏻‍♂️
INFJ|if you’re already an @LetterkennyProb devoted fan, I can’t recommend highly enough looking for #letterkennylive tour date near you , scrounge a ticket if you can. An old school vaudeville revue. Madcap , sidesplitting. Keeso, Tierney , the whole gang, BP , I were starstruck 🙌🏼 🇨🇦
INFJ|A few recommendations for fun diversion to keep your mood up in troubled times. The shit that’s been working for me #1, as I’ve noted before, if you haven’t seen the Canadian masterpiece that is Letterkenny @LetterkennyProb you’re missing out on the best laughs…
INFJ|Bless you, José. @chefjoseandres You are a great chef but an even greater humanitarian. So many people are feeling powerless to do anything for the millions in Ukraine who are assaulted, displaced , desperate. Here’s a way to help people directly. Support @WCKitchen
INFJ|I’ve had this song on repeat for weeks. It’s one of the best RHCP tracks in a long time. Like the best of ‘Tommy’. Real emotion , yearning fused w power rock anthem. Hearing John back on the 6 makes me cry happy tears! I needed this fix! 🤘🏼
INFJ|100% correct
INFJ|Amen 100x
INFJ|dont be idle. This toad sitting on an oil pipe will not overthrow itself. Actions not words of sympathy or support. Donating monthly from now until the toad is overthrown. May this hero lead Russia one day. Stay strong @navalny
INFJ|Something positive on #WorldWaterDay Really proud of our team @CambrianInno for their pioneering work to prove that conserving water , reducing energy delivers huge financial savings. Kudos to ABI a major American beverage company showing sustainability can increase profit 👏🏼
INFJ|Protecting biodiversity is about much more than saving threatened iconic species, obviously. But alongside policy scale efforts we still need to engage young people , create a sense of direct connection to wildlife from our urbanized lives. Great to do as a family or a company
INFJ|There’s a lot of brutality on display these days , it’s hard to focus on other things when watching the daily horror being inflicted on the people of Ukraine. But working on positive efforts keeps my optimism up. So I’m happy to partner w @kwskenya on this 
INFJ|Very important perspective in this thread
INFJ|A lot of people are wondering how to support Ukraine , what fundraising campaigns are legit. This👇🏼 gives a good summary of the ‘hub’ @gofundme set up to guide us to various options , gives a lot of detail , links on methodologies used to verify. 
INFJ|Even with all the geopolitical chaos, we can’t be so distracted as to not pay attention to this latest climate report. Humanity is like a family indulging in arguments around the dinner table while the house is burning down around them.
INFJ|National leaders of real courage, people willing to risk actual loss of freedom or life, come along so rarely. Vaclav Havel. Nelson Mandela. Alexei Navalny. Now @ZelenskyyUa Praying he doesn’t become a martyr to humanity isn’t enough. Fight alongside him now.
INFJ|Putin’s money is a global virus. Rule of law, and enforcement of the law, is the vaccine. We have superior resources , talent in every dimension to defeat this pissant mob. We need to look to Ukraine , summon the will to act with half their determination , courage. 🇺🇦💪🏼
INFJ|the kleptocratic ruin they made of Russia, where they can’t evade the righteous fury of the brave , humanistic Russian populace that has also had enough. Civilians, mothers are manning barricades in Kyiv , getting beaten, arrested in Moscow! What’s our excuse for half-measures?
INFJ|If we really can’t call Vlad’s bluff right now with force of arms, let’s at least stand alongside Ukraine by going on offense with extreme prejudice, exposing the American Vichy stooges, freezing RUS out of the society they cynically enjoy , exploit, reduce their world to…
INFJ|If @ZelenskyyUa , brave Ukraine men , women can stand in their streets w/ light weapons , a few Javelins against a mechanized army , say ‘Fuck you!’ to the whiny, belligerent insanity of a THUG dictator , his petro-mafiya, can’t we take inspiration , defend our own democracy?
INFJ|By the roots. Bring full hazard of the rule of law down on the collaborators , perpetrators. Individual govt , military officials w/ debt or undisclosed compensation, orgs acting as pass-throughs for illegal contributions, oligarch-owned businesses, shady real estate deals…
INFJ|Maxing out to this guy. Enough of ‘good ol’ boys’ with cow udders where a neck should be thinking their Foghorn Leghorn southern fried bullshit can gloss their Russian-asset, racist actions , just plain ignorant incompetence. We need talented, caring people who will fight for US.
INFJ|Yes.
INFJ|👇🏼whole thread 100 percent
INFJ|What heartbreak to hear this news. Paul Farmer is without a doubt one of the most loving, funny, generous , inspiring people to grace humanity with his soul in our lifetimes. If you were lucky enough to know him, your life was altered for the better. Dr Paul forever in our hearts
INFJ|Love this guy. A hero EVERY month!
INFJ|@flea333 Feels weird to ‘like’ this… I told you to stop gargling the water when we were out at 2nd Point on Sunday!
INFJ|👇🏼 every bit of this
INFJ|I’m over here laughing just thinking about what they’re all looking at. Wouldn’t you like to know? Buy the ticket. Take the ride. RJ is a freakin’ maestro of hilarity , crime. I’ll say no more.
INFJ|A-fk’in-men 👇🏼💯 It’s so obscene that this is even up for debate.
INFJ|To us he will always be ‘Bob’. Those were some wonderful months of laughter , irreverence. The hardest thing about working w/ Meat was getting through any of these ridiculous moments without cracking up. Him lying on the table playing dead then belting out Zeppelin. Good times 🙏 
INFJ|I don’t keep pictures from films around home. But I have this one in my office in a frame bc it makes me smile every time. It’s engraved ‘Love and Hugs, Meat’ it sums him up well. He was so funny. And gentle. And warm to everyone. A sweet soul. RIP Meat Loaf 
INFJ|Ha ha! 👇🏼. Hard agree. @GavinNewsom , this decision on solar isn’t a hilariously satirical movie (😎)…it’s the actual future our kids will have to live in. Don’t make CA punch itself in the face and fall through a glass coffee table. It will actually hurt. Trust me!
INFJ|We need to get loud about this. This is truly a moment of truth , choice between an American Renewal, characterized by the technological innovation , entrepreneurial dynamism that made this country a powerhouse or remaining shackled to broken , dirty system
INFJ|Another good piece 
INFJ|There is a huge grassroots effort to convince the Governor , the CPUC to scrap this residential solar killer proposal , look for a better way to make changes to the current system that will let rooftop solar continue to grow , protect our environment and climate.
INFJ|For those interested in a really comprehensive point-by-point takedown of how truly horrendously ill-conceived this CPUC proposal is, see below. I have never seen a Proposed Decision (PD) that is as regressive and out-of-touch with reality as this one
INFJ|This , other aspects of the proposal all designed to punish consumers who are realizing it makes terrific economic sense to go solar. all pushed by the utilities to protect their control over CAs energy system even while our state is burning , drying out due to climate change
INFJ|And they are proposing slashing the amount customers will be paid (credited) for any clean power they share back to the grid. They don’t even want to have credit a customer for clean distributed power the homeowner supplies to the grid at the rate they then sell that power for!
INFJ|They’ve been in Gov @GavinNewsom , regulator ears , now California regulators are proposing to adopt rules that will destroy the rooftop solar market in CA by imposing very high fees on customers who install solar (about $60/month additional flat fee for an average customer).
INFJ|For example, California utilities like PG,E want to maintain their monopoly , look for every opportunity to kill rooftop solar which liberates customers from their control. Decentralized matrix of customers producing their own clean energy , saving money hurts their share price
INFJ|Renewable energy industry is one of highest growth American economic stories. But one of biggest impediments to acceleration of this transformation is the determined resistance of antiquated, sclerotic centralized utilities that don’t want energy independent American consumers
INFJ|The good news is that within this challenge is one of the biggest economic opportunities in human history skilled jobs, hugely profitable new industries, massive investor returns alongside reduction of trillions $ dirty energy framework costs us in health , environmental damage.
INFJ|it is causing our economy , our very lives. This means we MUST decarbonize our economy , transition to electrification of transportation , energy use in homes , offices , data centers etc. To do this at scale we MUST transition to renewable energy
INFJ|A thread for those interested in why we should all care about policy that promotes (not discourages) mass adoption of residential solar energy 1) we’re in a transformational moment for our society. We MUST confront the dire threat of climate change , the disruptions
INFJ|The proposed revisions to CA solar power regulations by CPUC are an absolute disaster for CA’s jobs, CA’s capacity to meet emission reduction targets, the national solar industry , transformation of America’s energy model. @GavinNewsom you must not let this happen. 
INFJ|📢#ACTNOW is the @UN campaign for individual action on climate change and sustainability. Join me and support the #ACTNOW campaign 👉 to create positive change and accelerate progress. Every action counts!
INFJ|To all saying ‘They can’t tip their hand by talking about it’, sure…but, no. This details what’s missing in a very cogent way. Follow thread if @tribelaw for more affirmation from legal scholar who was Garland’s prof.
INFJ|And hard agree with this 👇🏼.Way too much positive effusion about a speech that had commendable reaffirmations of principle but is belied by a roaring absence of even the quiet actions that would indicate true intent to hold planners accountable.
INFJ|Nobody should think for a minute that it was ‘spontaneous chaos’ or ‘got out of hand’. Every bit of this is correct 👇🏼

INFJ|It’s important in psychologically challenging times to acknowledge , celebrate people , accomplishments that inspire us , reinvigorate hope. Superheroes in the movies are just actors in costumes. Here are nine real life heroes- the amazing winners of this years @Brkthroughprize
INFJ|👇🏼
INFJ|He had a really rare gift for being fully present in the moment , for conveying the layers under the words. He ran so deep. He was also kind , generously enthusiastic. I’ll be forever grateful that he graced ‘Motherless Brooklyn’ , that I got to share space , time w him. RIP💔
INFJ|I feel punched in gut to learn we’ve lost Michael K Williams. Soul anguished. Getting to work with him was one of the greatest privileges I’ve had in my career. My admiration for his talent was boundless, like so many. If he was in a scene he was the best thing about it. Period.
INFJ|Amen.
INFJ|I ‘hosted’ Episode 2 of this excellent podcast, highlighting the inspiring story , work of Nzambi Matee. Check it out. No Denying It - The UN Climate Action Podcast

INFJ|Tony Hillery is a hero. One of my favorite people. @HarlemGrown is a beautiful American story of inspiration and possibility.
INFJ|As @UN Goodwill Ambassador I am joining #TheHumanRace. This is a race for our planet. For our lives. For our future. The race against the climate crisis is the most important race of our lives. Join us. 
INFJ|This is terrifically well-written, funny , on point.
INFJ|👇🏼💯
INFJ|Denialism , obfuscation need to have legal , financial consequence. But we need much more robust incentive , stimulation for clean energy, transportation , efficiency as well as carbon reduction tech. The substance of the Green New Deal isn’t radical. It’s common sense.
INFJ|lead, , make the imposed price for polluting prohibitive to any viable business model. We’ve been too slow to grasp that corporations have privatized their profits , socialized costs of their environmental abuse but this report makes it painfully clear that the bill has arrived.
INFJ|‘How can we sleep while our beds are burning?’ I hadn’t listened to that great battle-cry of a song by Midnight Oil in a while but it’s never been more resonant. Unprecedented fires all around the globe. Biblical floods from intensifying storms, mass die offs of marine life… 1)
INFJ|‘With freedom comes responsibility. Amen
INFJ|Big congrats to @planet , @Will4Planet , his team. To me this is a company that defines what ‘ESG’ business should be, truly doing well by doing good. The data they generate is absolutely transformative for biodiversity conservation, ocean , forest monitoring, climate analysis.
INFJ|A perfectly pitched meditation for this Independence Day.
INFJ|A must read

INFJ|Amen
INFJ|Greg Knoll passed on … I hope to cosmic great waves for all eternity. The older I get the more I’ll dream of being young like him. Rest in Glory

INFJ|Saturday music bulletin a certain English friend of mine from a band you know well is going on at Glastonbury Live tonight w his new ‘side project’. See you in the cyber mosh 
INFJ|@RedHourBen Yes to all but for me it’s ‘Midnight Run’. I can quote every line , laugh just as hard every time. Watch him actually break DeNiro up on the bus w the ‘Put the cigarette out, Jack’ riff. Bob actually cracks up, looks off camera , says ‘What a pain in the ass this guy is!’ RIP

INFJ|Blunt, correct and urgent. It’s Earth Day, take a moment to watch this
INFJ|What action will you take this #EarthDay to make a positive impact on the environment? There’s an app to help you on your journey in support of the @UN #ActNow campaign – check out log your #ClimateAction , share it with the world! 
INFJ|5 years after the adoption of the #ParisAgreement, the world has not done nearly enough to tackle the climate emergency. #EarthDay is a reminder To keep our planet livable, we must #ActNow. 
INFJ|👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
INFJ|Shame on these people.
INFJ|RIP DMX. His records always reminded me of the Lanford Wilson line about great art Make it personal, make it true. And then write ‘Burn This’ on the cover.
INFJ|🤣🤣
INFJ|The Republican Party that created the EPA , passed the Clean Air Act (Nixon) , took some pride in responsibility to protect the American people from actual threats (not just racist bogeyman phantoms) is long gone. Florida GOP has been warned about this for decades. They own it.
INFJ|It’s a good argument for why the GOP, with its single ‘policy’ of corporate socialism at the expense of actual American people, shouldn’t be in charge of a fucking yard sale. They really don’t have the chops to handle even basic necessary management of public health , safety.
INFJ|And yet the weave of his own life through the workhow he used it, altered it, deviated from it entirely into pure imagination has always been a mystery to me. The only logistical question is can I get through this in two days or will it take three?
INFJ|I’m on board for literally any subject @KenBurns guides us into simply because he’s one of America’s greatest storytellers. I plan a long residency on the couch with my feet up , my mind primed. But I’m particularly excited for this one because EH’s work had such an impact on me
INFJ|Anyone who leads a company should read this
INFJ|These guys also played down Covid and mocked wearing masks. So I’m thinking maybe they are wearing them here because they know it’s better to hide their faces from the historical record, which will document them as the racists they are.
INFJ|Hard agree

INFJ|Come on Perseverance!!! @NASA @NASAJPL
INFJ|@tonyposnanski Texas making a STRONG run at your claim right now.
INFJ|Has anyone ever seemed so proud of their own abject stupidity? We’d love to ‘count you out’, John. Out of the Senate. Good people of TX deserve so much better. His pitch is let’s be ignorant, behind the curve , keep doing harm to ourselves , our kids , never learn anything new
INFJ|@JohnCornyn God you really are a dipshit, aren’t you? @elonmusk it’s good you’re moving to TX bc maybe you can explain to this twit where we are on grid scale storage capacity , that burning hydrocarbons isn’t the only (or even cheapest) way a modern USA can handle peak demand @billmckibben

INFJ|If anyone is wondering why I’m writing this I co-founded EDO with my friend Dr. Daniel Nadler (founder , ex-CEO of Kensho). Biased? Yup. But we assembled this all-star team , we’re incredibly proud of the brilliant work they’re doing. @karaswisher @profgalloway @jonahgoodhart
INFJ|Data based on mid-funnel consumer behaviors predictive of eventual sales brings what digital ad platforms have been able to deliver to the urgently needed evolution of Convergent TV. If your company’s research budget doesn’t reflect this revolution, you’re behind the curve.
INFJ|And we’ll throw down , say that efficacy analysis rooted in real time Search Engagement Rate is the new gold standard metric for cost/performance analysis. Bullshit social sentiment or weak sauce multi-touch attribution signal, sorry…no. Debate us on this, we welcome it.
INFJ|Convergent TV advertising supports a $100B creative industry , underwrites the work of some of our most brilliant creators , storytellers Counting how many people (probably) sat in front of a screen when an ad ran is entirely insufficient as a pricing metric , has been for years
INFJ|Great data engineering , world-class data science allow EDO to handle enormous, unruly data sets with statistical rigor in near real-time , produce finance-grade actionable analytics in cloud-based software, reports, and APIs. Thats a modern tech platform.
INFJ|Nielsen has about 46,000 employees but it seems they can’t collect , sort data from 100k set-top boxes w reliable speed. You pay for that headcount, not speed or quality of insight We’re glad someone still does exposure but who on earth would price ad inventory off that in 2021?
INFJ|EDO achieves this w/ just over 50 brilliant people on our team. We process 1TB of video , 3.6B fingerprint hashes per hour, storing it all in the cloud. We know how to automate. We have some of the legit top ML / AI DS , Eng pros in the world. That drives powerful efficiency
INFJ|By 3am, EDO wraps its everyday routine, processing 1+ Petabyte of data covering anonymous, aggregated behavior of over 90% of the US pop. Producing investment grade insight on which ads most effectively drove actions tightly correlated w/ purchase intent , actual economic outcome
INFJ|Meanwhile, it took EDO a few hours after the game to complete its full SB report. During it we collected, processed , analyzed anonymized minute-by-minute searches of 100s of millions of people to assess effectiveness of every ad airing in , around the SB, virtually in real time
INFJ|It took around 36h for Nielsen to process data it collects from only 100K households. A pretty rudimentary system to then make a high-school math level extrapolation against US pop of 320million toward the stunning insight How many people probably watched (big yawn)
INFJ|Epic fail. But if youre an client, you don’t really care bc you had a much higher-value ad effectiveness report on this critical ad event by 3am, ready to discuss Monday morning (public version 👇, clients get much richer data) 
INFJ|To any companies who spent a bunch of $ on Super Bowl ads only to wake up , read (below) that Nielsen couldn’t deliver a low-tech ratings report for over 24 hours if you’re crazy enough to still be relying on Nielsen for insights, you’re shit out of luck 
INFJ|Thank you, @JoeBiden, for protecting the Arctic Refuge by halting all leasing activities! This is a great first step toward the long term protection of the Arctic Refuge. #ProtectTheArctic #StandWithTheGwichin 
INFJ|They’re trying to slow down Garland’s confirmation because they’re terrified of his prowess in prosecuting people who have oh rightdone the things they just did. Participation in seditious conspiracy , insurrection will tend to make you want to hamper law enforcement.
INFJ|Read these examples of the executive compensation boondoggle of corporate America, where CEO pay wildly disconnected from both average worker pay , from performance , then, after they are out, they don’t even pay taxes at same rate as workers. True contempt for working Americans
INFJ|This is hugely important thread for Americans to read. It reads like an indictment of our society in a court of human interest. It cannot , will not sustain. Societies throughout history have collapsed when too many slave for the benefit of the few. @aoc @paulkrugman @ewarren
INFJ|@adamdavidson Couldn’t agree more. With Epstein it’s always about young girls , kompromat. Everyone puzzling over the ‘mystery’ of the financial relationship between a private equity kingpin , a hack ‘tax strategist’ should look up Occam’s Razor.
INFJ|@GreggSmithCO3 @laurenboebert Go man go! Thank you! Tell us where to donate!
INFJ|2021 is a critical year for climate change and biodiversity. @antonioguterres calls on every city, company , financial institution to adopt concrete #ClimateAction plans , get to carbon neutrality by 2050. 
INFJ|Pausing tonight to hail the great Cicely Tyson, who passed today. At some point in my young life my school ran ‘The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman’ , her astonishing performance was the very first time I remember realizing that great acting was a magic trick , a craft. RIP ❤️
INFJ|There’s no technology that can replace these magnificent pollinators. Huge parts of global agriculture economy would crater without them. And yet we take them for granted and fail to protect them from pesticides and other threats.
INFJ|And’Diet Proud Boy’ wins the day. Let’s make it stick to fascist-wannabe @HawleyMO forever
INFJ|These are very important insights that we’re not seeing reported in MSM. @nytimes @deanbaquet stop doing Fox’s work for them w Peloton , Rolex stories , put some work into the deep roots of how millions are getting radicalized
INFJ|Ya think? The hypocritical whining of the Snowflake Republicans would be amusing if the gaslighting hadn’t become so actually dangerous.
INFJ|Congratulations! But really, ‘congratulations to us’. we need you , your vision for Tribal lands becoming renewable energy powerhouses!
INFJ|Righteous and right on.
INFJ|You can also donate from wherever you are. CORE is an incredible , hugely inspiring organization. Co-founded by my friend Sean Penn, it really represents the best of the American can-do spirit , reaffirms that when we all pitch in we can meet any challenge , lift each other up.

INFJ|@staceyabrams @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris Thank you, Stacey, for all that you have done to make this day a reality. Deeply inspired by you.
INFJ|@sacca I think it’s that Bannon 1) is setting up financing for Trump Mob from his Chinese pal whose yacht he hangs out on 2) knows way too much about everything else related to 2016 campaign to risk leaving him twisting in the wind, looking for a way to reduce his sentence.
INFJ|Actors , stunt professionals at every level of the trade this is worth watching 100’s of times (as I have just done) to study the precise physical dynamics , choreography of movement / eye-line at play here that lead to SUCH a satisfying punch line. VERY hard to replicate.
INFJ|@glennkirschner2 Glen, in the cases of Bannon , especially Stone, Flynn, Manafort etc, if the pardons are issued in furtherance of covering up the President’s own crime, can they not be challenged and voided? Along with self-pardon one would think that a pardon of a co-conspirator is illegal
INFJ|Careful. A ‘Gimp of Putin’ such as yourself doesn’t want to annoy his master. He might put you back in the dog collar , shove the red ball in your mouth , bring you to heel. Or just leak how much of his money has made it into your campaign coffers. You carry his water and we see.

INFJ|Enterprise NYC was my first job out of college , what they are doing on access to capital, public / private partnership in housing development, sustainability standards in affordable, policy = truly revolutionary , inspiring.
INFJ|So many heroic Americans are indeed doing this work. I want to highlight the incredible work of Enterprise Community Partners @EnterpriseNow No organization in America is doing more to increase opportunity , transform communities of poverty thru affordable housing development.
INFJ|of pernicious, unblunted, systemic, murderous racism that our friends, colleagues , fellow Americans live under. Any of us who thinks we do ‘enough’, read that letter from a jail in Birmingham and reassess based on MLK’s criteria.
INFJ|The last 4 years, , especially the last week, should have brought white America fully up , out of the self-satisfying dream that we have participated fully , sufficiently in creating equality in this country , awoken everyone of conscience to the painful enduring reality
INFJ|Because it’s devastating that it’s STILL as directly applicable , descriptive of social conditions for African Americans TODAY! It should be a part of the historical record that we look back on , mark as the clarion call that helped END racial injustice, bigotry, white supremacy
INFJ|I just re-read ‘Letter from a Birmingham Jail’. Full text here There are too many great lines in this brilliant, forceful, compassionate but fierce piece of writing to quote. I think all white Americans of good conscience should read it today.
INFJ|Today’s meditation MLK Day isn’t like Labor Day, it’s not a holiday from work. It’s the opposite. It’s a day dedicated TO work. To continue his work. To read his exhortations , recommit to dedicating our personal time, resources , courage to advance his cause in his absence.
INFJ|Agree 💯. Brilliantly expressed. I wish that I held almost any hope that anyone In the intended audience will encounter it, absorb it or take it to heart. But bravo to @thematthewcooke nonetheless. Sometimes just speaking the full unvarnished truth inspires others to stand firm
INFJ|👇🏼
INFJ|👇🏼 amplify
INFJ|The only significant element I feel is missing from this really excellent summation is the huge influence of money injected into the GOP at large by foreign antagonists like Russia who benefit massively from America becoming another anti-democratic oligarchy. They are compromised
INFJ|Very very important that more people absorb the truth in this very astute analysis so that we collectively see behind the veil to understand what’s actually happening and focus our efforts on the right targets
INFJ|It’s staggering how many fake-Christians are willing to vote to lower taxes on billionaires , corporations while casually brutalizing the working poor. Jesus would detest these people. We are a wealthy enough nation to lift up our poorest , our society benefits from this.
INFJ|It’s very important to watch all this.
INFJ|and each of its lying POS talking heads who cannot hide behind ‘opinion’ or ‘entertainment’ this time. Without moral hazard , consequence under law, we’re at risk of truly losing our capacity to fight tyranny.
INFJ|A panicked, insincere retraction that only shows they know how deep in legal shit they’ve put themselves. Please @dominionvoting you have real power to create meaningful deterrence , change. Don’t be dissuaded. Sue them for massive damages , pursue the same redress against Fox.
INFJ|@dominionvoting You’ve set a powerful example of how media propaganda machines doing damage to our country can be held to account. PLEASE, for the good of America, don’t be pacified by these panicked, insufficient retractions. Sue them all for massive damages. We need real detterence.
INFJ|Hmm. I wonder where that $ was coming from. If Ronald Reagan came back and realized that the GOP had become the Gimps Of Putin, he’d never stop vomiting.
INFJ|The FB algo powers hate, violence, insurrection , sedition all for profit.

INFJ|This is a very unique , powerful personal historical perspective on the events of this week. I encourage everyone to take a few minutes and listen to it. Thank you, Arnold.
INFJ|of needed protection, participated in the conspiracy by denying support of federal troops. Do their positions as public officials shield them from civil liability for the deaths / injuries of these officers? Bc I’d love to see a smart lawyer open discovery on all these clowns.
INFJ|could file civil suit personally against Donald Trump, DT Jr, Hawley, Cruz, Giuliani, GOP AG’s , every other individual who directly planned, coordinated , amplified the calls to ‘get wild’ or wage ‘trial by combat’ in advance of this assault. Or w/ intent to deprive the Capitol
INFJ|A GoFundMe campaign for this murdered officer’s family is a worthy way to honor him 👇🏼. But I’d like to ask @nealkatyal @tribelaw , any top tort lawyers in this country (please forward to any you know), if the Sicknick family , other officers critically injured in this attack..
INFJ|This is nuts. Facebook is essentially an marketing firm for extremism. And they know it. And despite having all the resources necessary, do nothing about it. The public at large needs to wake up to the reality that this is a publisher, not a platform , support regulation.
INFJ|Absolutely dead on correct and one of our biggest challenges as a nation in the years ahead. Please read this thread
INFJ|Btw Executive Branch officials, heads of Security , Defense agencies , organizers. Capital murder occurred , national security was breached. Nobody involved should be charged with anything lighter than sedition, domestic terrorism, accessory to murder, augmented by conspiracy.
INFJ|Can we please stop calling it a riot? That makes it sound spontaneous , disorganized. It was planned and coordinated for many weeks. Violence was planned. The disruption of the function of Legislative branch was the goal. Murder was premeditated broadly. Coordination occurred
INFJ|Conspiring in support of planned violent assault on seat of government toward the goal of incapacitating legislative branch in which murder of a federal officer took place. Doubt she has to check w Clarence to know that’s a crime. @fbi ? Calling AG Garland @tedlieu @RepAdamSchiff 
INFJ|Couldn’t agree more with this assessment
INFJ|Remember all of them. They’ll be remembered as the 2nd Confederacy.
INFJ|1000x yes
INFJ|Amen
INFJ|correct 100%
INFJ|and by contrast.
INFJ|Arrest. Them. All. They are all felons.
INFJ|All this motherfer has to do is straighten is fingers to be fully, unapologetically who he actually is. @HawleyMO @tedcruz , the rest of the Fascist clownshow directly validated a mob attack component of this coup attempt when they perpetrated their seditious political piece.
INFJ|..and show what happens to those who mess with the United States of America.
INFJ|consequence of their actions , betrayal or we are no longer a nation of laws. No more coddling traitors, their enablers , foreign backers. @JoeBiden its on you , your DOJ , IC to bring the hammer of law down in righteous intolerance..
INFJ|As Trump has done , Ivanka Trump did just now, theyd be arrested within 24 hours for sedition , incitement of violence. We are at a profound moment of test of our principles. We either have rule of law that has teeth , these people receive the full appropriate lethal , legal
INFJ|If armed people of color, black, Latino, Muslim- stormed the US Capitol to disrupt the transfer of power following an election, thered be no tear gas , rubber bullets phase of the response. Theyd be shot dead before they got 10 steps into the grounds.
INFJ|Feeling oddly thankful that @staceyabrams had her own election stolen from her so that she had time to save America. So much work still to be done, but this morning I’m just deeply grateful for Stacey , many others who dedicated themselves to the cause of democracy #StaceyMyHero
INFJ|Together, let’s join @UN SG @antonioguterres’ call to make peace among ourselves and with nature, tackle the climate crisis, stop the spread of COVID-19 , make 2021 a year of healing. That must be our New Year’s Resolution for 2021.

INFJ|Let’s make that anyone doing frontline medical duty exposed to Covid who has student debt or a child with student debt. A GI Bill for people risking their lives every day in a fight that could end up ending as many American lives as WW2. @SpeakerPelosi @senatemajldr @JoeBiden ?
INFJ|in common cause against a common enemy. This isn’t ‘a flu’. More American are dying every two days than died in the 9-11 attack. A worthy challenge to reconnect with what the UNITED States of America can do when we set our minds , hearts against a problem. We can beat this.
INFJ|Trying to save the lives of our families, friends, neighbors, colleaguesor maybe you. Literally all that’s being asked of us is to wear masks , be disciplined for a few more months. Think about how our grandparents pushed political disagreements to the side , pull together

INFJ|Faith in the strength of our sacred institutions , founding principles is severely stretchedbut they will hold. They will. He’s leaving, gracelessly , in infamy. But if we trade for it, give him some brokered settlement, we’ll be vulnerable to his return. We can’t flinch.
INFJ|But his contemptible, treasonous, seditious assault on the stability of our political compact isn’t about 2024, personal enrichment or anything else other than trying to use chaos , threat to the foundation of the system as leverage to trade for a safe exit. Call. His. Bluff.
INFJ|I will allow that he’s also a whiny, sulky, petulant, Grinchy, vindictive little 10-ply-super-soft bitch who no doubt is just throwing a wicked pout fest , trying to give a tiny-hand middle finger to the whole country for pure spite, without a single thought for the dead , dying
INFJ|His ‘turn card’ bluff will be an escalation , his ‘River card’ bluff could be really ugly. But they have to be called. We cannot let this mobster bully the USA into a deal to save his ass by threatening our democracy. THAT is his play. But he’s got junk in his hand. So call him.
INFJ|which is to create enough chaos , anxiety about peaceful transfer of power, , fear of irreparable damage to the system, that he can cut a Nixon-style deal in exchange for finally conceding. But he doesn’t have the cards. His bluff after ‘the flop’ has been called in court
INFJ|or that ‘chaos is what he loves’. The core of it is that he knows he’s in deep, multi-dimensional legal jeopardy , this defines his every action. We’re seeing 1) a tactical delay of the transition to buy time for coverup , evidence suppression 2) above all, a desperate endgame
INFJ|I’m no political pundit but I grew up w a dad who was a federal prosecutor , he taught me a lot , I’ve also sat a fair amount of poker w serious players , l’ll say this I do not think Trump is trying to ‘make his base happy’ or ‘laying the groundwork for his own network’
INFJ|This is way beyond ‘trampling on norms’. We seem to be steadily losing any determination to enforce moral or legal hazard. If people flout laws with impunity, what’s to create any sense of risk deterrence , how long until we just can’t maintain rule of law?
INFJ|Joking aside, could some constitutional , criminal law experts weigh in on whether actively, in the public forum, inciting illegal actions to upend the results of lawful elections meets criminal standards of sedition or insurrection laws? @nealkatyal @PreetBharara @tribelaw ?
INFJ|Thank you. LONG overdue.

INFJ|Perfect B-side to the deep commentary from @VanJones68
INFJ|Thank you @VanJones68 I mean, I didn’t plan to be weeping along with you in front of my kids in the kitchen but you’re rightit’s easier to be a parent today. Easier to tell them truth matters , character matters. 
INFJ|I’m actually a little bit shaky with relief. Nothing has made me feel sustained anxiety , dismay for this long other than loved ones being seriously ill. That’s how this felt, except the sick loved one was America , I feel like we just got the news that she’s going to recover ❤️

INFJ|Correct. Commit their names to memory and make sure they join Trump in infamy and hold them to account.
INFJ|Talk about putting ‘democracy’ in hard quotation marks. People need to get educated on the racist roots of the Electoral College system and it’s later preservation by segregationists so we build consensus that it’s past time to eliminate it.
INFJ|Yesssss
INFJ|Amen! Maxing out with you. Thank you @staceyabrams !
INFJ|🔥🔥
INFJ|that protects him in exchange for finally conceding. That’s what he’s playing for , he’ll totally flip the table , set the house on fire to try to get it bc what’s on the other side is bleak. I fear he’ll make things as messy as possible to leverage a deal.
INFJ|It would be nice to have confidence in the below except that I think it is a misread on his goals. He knows that indictment , prosecution almost certainly await him in NYS , so the more chaos he causes by refusing transfer of power the more likely he gets a settlement
INFJ|Can you imagine how police in this country would respond to a crowd of angry black citizens ranting about stopping the normal counting of votes in an election and asserting their ‘open carry rights’ by brandishing guns? I can.
INFJ|Truth. Beautifully expressed and so important to absorb. We can’t stay in love with the mirage of an inspiring national narrative that has in fact excluded, and literally killed, whole communities.
INFJ|Fuck these un-American cultists , their cry-baby Clown Emperor. He won these states four years ago by margins tinier than his orange hands. nobody said ‘Stop the count’ A lot of us wanted Jaime H to beat that troll Lindsay G but nobody yelled ‘stop counting’ when he was ahead.
INFJ|Imagine if you’re in the US armed forces, risking your life overseas or the Peace Corps serving our country abroad , you vote absentee in Michigan , you have to listen to people demanding your vote not be counted. Not even claiming fraud, just saying ‘Stop counting legal votes’.
INFJ|@LaFemmeNegrita @MarkRuffalo Appreciate you deeply!!
INFJ|@verizon @GetSpectrum come on!! Safety of kids in their awesome urban garden compromised! Come clean up your equipment!!
INFJ|If the legal, mailed-on-time mail ballots held up in USPS sites and XPO trucks by DeJoy were ordered found, delivered , counted, Biden would also win at least one of PA / GA / NC, larger margins in MI, WI, AZ, NV and FL would be worth revisiting
INFJ|More detail on this issue. Look at where delivery rates are especially low , what the effect would be of 300,000 votes spread across these states, given their margins. There’s vote suppression but this is outright vote cancellation. Theft. Who’s got legal standing to litigate?
INFJ|It would seem to me this could significantly affect final totals in WI / MI / PA / GA / FL / AZ / TX / NC
INFJ|or anyone else if Judge Sullivan holds DeJoy / USPS in contempt , orders legally mailed ballots delivered , counted what is the legal tactic / process by states can be forced to wait for , count potentially hundreds of thousands of mail in votes? Because
INFJ|Have significant numbers of ballots being withheld from the count due to this intentional slowing of the mail process , refusal to ‘sweep’ for them and deliver them. A lot of very informed people follow this feed. @tedlieu @tribelaw @TheRickWilson @SteveSchmidtSES @nealkatyal
INFJ|It seems increasingly clear that the Postmaster General has at the very least hampered court ordered actions to deliver legally submitted ballots, mailed in plenty of time. In large numbers. It seems that the states still in play (, maybe some that were called but close
INFJ|Amen

INFJ|Former Republican Gov of PA admirably putting country over party. Respect to you @GovRidge
INFJ|Good people in PA be alert the mail in ballots deadline is has been passed. Deliver in person or vote in person or it is unlikely to be counted.
INFJ|This isn’t fear mongering. It’s important to absorb and be prepared for.
INFJ|Beautiful. Please share. May all the decent folks in Wisconsin rise and reject hate and corruption of our values.
INFJ|Kudos to both of you. What a wonderful example of how things can , should be in this country. @SpencerJCox @PetersonUtah Thanks for your principled, decent and pointed declaration

INFJ|🤦‍♂️
INFJ|Read this @JoeBiden , @KamalaHarris. Read the whole thing , commit to no quarter , no more deference to norms that have been atomized by craven hypocrites. Neutralize this offense by playing offense. USE YOUR MANDATE.

INFJ|This is a deep, wise meditation on, and answer to, a question that has been bothering , confounding so many Americans Why do so many people still follow Trump adoringly? I’d say this analysis by @jeffblack945 gets closer to the heart of it than anything I’ve read yet.
INFJ|The Boss knows what PA needs, needs to do and what we all need to rise and do together.
INFJ|I wonder which he gets so amused by 1) the very idea that anyone has sentiment for the poor regular people who have died 2) the glee he just can’t hide over what he’s gotten away with or 3) the notion that a woman is allowed to question him , that he’s expected to answer
INFJ|Perfectly maps , articulates the degree to which @GOP is a group of intellectual charlatans, espousing a faux mantra of ‘conservatism’ that is in fact a veneer for pure plutocratic, white, male protectionism resistant to every achievement of social progress in the last 100 years
INFJ|from Reconstruction to the New Deal to the civil rights revolution, conservatives have long felt genuinely victimized by the prospect of equality. That doesn’t mean, however, that bad-faith right-wing arguments about the courts merit a respectful hearing. 💯% dead on 1)
INFJ|It only offends them until they need it. In truth it never actually offends them. Theyweaponize ‘faith based values’ that they have no actual personal commitment to (and which, in private, they mock) to distract their base from paying attention to how they rig the game , swindle
INFJ|party, a new banner, a new commitment to the collective good. Because the Republican Party has joined the Confederacy, and the Vichy French in the infamy reserved for those who betray their own nation and perpetrate violence against their own people. To hell with them.
INFJ|that great man the minute Eisenhower left office. But now they’ve surrendered forever any claim to being the party of Reagan as well. They’re just the party of Trump. Which means they’re the Party of Putin. Any so-called conservative with a conscience better come up with a new
INFJ|to support Russian interests as a way of financing , perpetuating their own political futures, Reagan would have unhesitatingly called them traitors and moved against them with the full force of the law. Forget the ‘party of Lincoln’, the GOP lost any claim to alignment with
INFJ|I disagree with nearly every policy he set in motion but you couldn’t say for one minute he wasn’t a patriot , if even one Democrat, let alone the whole party, had been revealed to be up to 1/10th of the tacit support, let alone active collusion, the current GOP has perpetrated
INFJ|This is the ‘party of Ronald Reagan’ today. Gleefully working hand in glove with Russian military intelligence to deploy their disinformation campaign. Reagan, the standard bearer of what used to be modern GOP conservatism, who called Russia ‘an evil empire, is raging somewhere
INFJ|Correct. 100%. Bipartisanship became a one-way street decades ago. The GOP has been declaring ‘heads I win, tails you lose’ with regard to honoring every procedural norm regarding the Judiciary. Tune out their howling, toughen up , give them a strong dose of their own meds
INFJ|This is a good read about my very good friend Tony Hillery, one of the most inspiring people I know. 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼

INFJ|We need lots of people to be ambassadors for #biodiversity. We need artists, politicians, entrepreneurs, etc. We need everyone to think about and talk about how their actions impact biodiversity and then make positive changes #ForNature. 
INFJ|A new report from @UNBiodiversity shows the world has missed its 2020 biodiversity targets. But #GBO5 also shows areas of progress - and a way forward. We know what the solutions are. We need political will to turn the science into policy , action.

INFJ|Beautifully expressed reaction to the ‘debate’ debacle. Can we all promise each other to not just check our own registration status, vote in person if you can safely, get your ballots in by mail early if you can’t
INFJ|Beautifully said! Even the Drumpfs had to make their way here to rebrand themselves as Trumps. And Melania. And her parents. Fostering active contempt for empathy toward others is one of Trump’s worst offenses against the American ideal.
INFJ|100% correct. @AOC also full correct. We don’t have a ‘race issue’. We have a racism issue. Donald Trump is a vile, unrepentant, dangerous racist. We have to rise to this moment in unprecedented numbers and vote this thug out
INFJ|Amen. Shameful
INFJ|It’s absurd at this point to put question marks on all this. It would have told us that he’s indebted to Russians (, Saudis). And that that’s who he hopes / expects to get money from in the future. And that this is why he champions their interests , is silent on their atrocities
INFJ|Most important single question for Americans today.
INFJ|. , was this used as leverage to negotiate Justice Kennedy’s retirement?
INFJ|And loans coming through Deutchebank don’t legitimize it. The institution has a known history of enabling money laundering. Who collateralized the loans? Because Trump could not. @FoxNewsSunday please ask this question in the debate. Americans must know who owns the President
INFJ|The concluding question here is important for our country at a level that can’t be overstated. an unprecedented question. Bc if foreign interests hold debt obligations over our President, especially if connected to our enemies and/or criminals, he’s a traitor , should go to jail.
INFJ|Truly, this is not a drill. Not hyperbole. We are facing an existential threat to the bi-partisan commitment to the democratic process. He is willing and eager to burn down nearly 250 years of hard fought progress toward ‘a more perfect union’
INFJ|Amen
INFJ|Precisely correct. Wrapping criminality and terrorism in 2nd Amendment poached semantics, conveniently ignoring the ‘well-regulated’ criteria, which these thugs are emphatically not.

INFJ|I’m late to the party , now binge catching up. But even doing too many per week, there’s at least one bit or mind-melting verbal riff in literally every episode that leaves me gasping w laughter, rewinding , trying to imitate, which can’t be done, even by top professionals!
INFJ|FWIW ‘Letterkenny’ has been my best mood elevation lately. the funniest damn show I’ve seen since original UK ‘Office’. It’s that order of brilliant. @jaredkeeso writing, vocal genius , physical comedy is Simpson’s / Peter Sellers / Charlie Chaplin level great. Whole cast A++

INFJ|Just a ‘normal day’ in Trump-land. But it can’t be accepted as anything less that what it is collusion with a mafia state working actively to dismantle our democratic institutions. @SpeakerPelosi @RepAdamSchiff @tedlieu what is being done?! Do Something please
INFJ|Amen
INFJ|Because white racists don’t shoot other white racist murderers who they are, reluctantly, forced to arrest
INFJ|Amen. Especially when there’s a lot to be angry about. (Love this feed, btw @brainpickings Wonderfully grounding , inspiring thoughts, images, perspectives, wisdom on a daily drip) 
INFJ|Correct
INFJ|I admire her articulation of need for Lebanese expats around the world to become a network of direct support to individuals in the absence of trust that traditional aid mechanisms can penetrate governmental corruption. In such a situation, small individual efforts really do count
INFJ|My good friend Pia, an American citizen born , raised in Lebanon, has put together this campaign for direct assistance to families in need, which I’m proud to support , spread the word about. 
INFJ|I relate deeply to this and agree with every sentiment in it. If there’s one thing we ought to be able to agree on it’s protecting the incredible shared treasure of our public lands , wild places. A great way to support that mission is to contribute to @ConservationLF
INFJ|I’ve gotten pretty worn out on people referring to the climate crisis as a ‘slow motion catastrophe’.
INFJ|This is a wonderful, heartwarming book for kids about how everyone can contribute , make magic happenexactly the message we need to share w kids right now. By a true NY hero, Tony Hillery founder of @HarlemGrown Get it, Gift it, be inspired!
INFJ|Exactly rightfor starters.
INFJ|This is truly nefarious , criminal. Talk about hacking at the roots of democracy
INFJ|Does anyone else feel like 2020 is the year where every single day brings another ‘Oh no’ bit of news?
INFJ|Important
INFJ|Pattern recognition is important in any complex system, from T-cells fighting infection to a chess grandmaster anticipating an attack to a storyteller understanding archetype. So let’s not fail to call these thugs what they are Fascists. And they have no place in the USA
INFJ|@karaswisher @ewarren Yes, driven largely by religious obsession with preserving the carried interest loophole that allows money managers like him to put $0 actual capital at risk , yet file their performance incentive fees as long term cap gains, make billions , pay less taxes than a teacher or cop
INFJ|Amen
INFJ|The answer seems fairly obvious
INFJ|All Americans should read this , understand how deeply rooted the antiquated Electoral College system is in racism , slavery. We should have moved to a national popular vote 200 years ago. And we should have it now. 
INFJ|Yes
INFJ|to repair the damage done to our Republic by these cynical clowns, back me up here. We need ethical conservatives helping their own constituency grow a spine when it comes to calling out this family that never even believed it’s own product. Just laughed all the way to the bank
INFJ|a big joke , we’re supposed to admire their business savvy. Fuck that. You paved the way for fascism to take root in the United States of America. That’s your legacy. Live with it. @ProjectLincoln @SteveSchmidtSES , other former GOP faithfuls who are working with real focus
INFJ|of that whole enterprise, work to actually dismantle it by revealing the deep truth of itthen let’s talk. @JuddApatow has been banging this drum loudly , it’s time more in our industry followed suit , called it out because they show up at our parties , act like it’s all
INFJ|Is supposed to make us embrace him as a progressive resistance fighter? Sorryhard no. That’s like Eichmann saying he was more progressive than Goebbels because he ‘moved to Argentina’. Give away your billions , write a book that really tells the truth about the cynicism
INFJ|and lied through his teeth about the whole affair. Now he wants an exit ramp back into grace , resigning from the most damaging propaganda machine ever deployed against human interest and wearing some open collar plaid shirts , pretending to care about the environment
INFJ|totally they are being screwed and laughed at by the plutocracy that Fox was really built to defend the interests of. And James Murdoch was head of the News of the World when they illegally hacked a dead girl’s phone (along with many others) and he sat in front of Parliament
INFJ|Yeah but you know what? Way too tepid , decades too late. This family has made billions for each of them on vomitous bile, slander, lies, hate-stoking, racist, misogynistic , anti-American propaganda to manipulate white working class Americans so that they don’t realize how
INFJ|👇🏼
INFJ|Yes, topics like ‘Vlad, exactly how many hours after election night will it take for your team to exfiltrate my ass to my new condo in Moscow? My kids tooif possible, greatbut not if it slows things down for Asset # 1 I’d just like clarity on exactly how I get out.
INFJ|Hopefully others follow this lead
INFJ|Obviously
INFJ|Amen
INFJ|👇🏼
INFJ|Where is the White House Press Corp? Have they all been drugged or zombified? How the living F has he not been asked about this ONCE?!
INFJ|When thugs and bullies who are really snowflakes get called out and play the victim. Such weak sauce.
INFJ|🤦🏻
INFJ|😂😂 @marcorubio you really are an epic, incompetent fool
INFJ|Excellent and specific summary of what voting rights legislation should contain. Read this thread. I’d add significant funding for election security and elimination of hackable electronic voting. @JoeBiden let’s hear from you on this? What are you committed to?
INFJ|Yes. 👇
INFJ|Brave move by Oregon US Attorney.
INFJ|This man was an American hero , an inspiring example of selfless courage. We’ve got a lot of work to do to realize the dream of true equal justice and equality that he dedicated his life to.
INFJ|Our grandparents would be dismayed to learn that they hit pause on their plans and dreams and risked their lives fighting Fascism overseas only to have Trump , Barr , their stormtroopers inflict it on Americans in our own cities.
INFJ|The great American 4th Estate, totally AWOL.
INFJ|@tribelaw Your mistaken assumption is that he can dress himself in the morning. He can’t. He has a manservant do it. Trump can’t bend down and touch his own knees. And his brain has equivalent range of movement.
INFJ|I’m joining Sir David Attenborough to support @OfficialZSL to ensure a world where wildlife thrives through their vital conservation and science initiatives. Please give what you can 
INFJ|Truly, how many more examples do we need to be slapped in the face with before we collectively wake up to the obvious truth that he works for them and not for us? We have an owned lap dog in our Presidency. Enough.
INFJ|#CorporateSocialists
INFJ|Yes. How has this story faded so fast? Think about how firmly compromised you have to be by your Russian handlers to not even muster up fake words of condemnation or a gestural indication that action will be taken, let alone really bit that Mob where it hurts , freeze their $ ?
INFJ|Ahem cough cough
INFJ|When a list like this is not hyperbole but a recitation of facts it’s impossible not to acknowledge that we’re in fairly unprecedented territory in terms of prosecuted criminality within an Administration.
INFJ|Please please, good people of Maine, rise to end the damage being done to our country by sending this simpering, hypocritical, morally bankrupt, passive aggressive enabler of racist, misogynist Trump into retirement , shame. @ProjectLincoln please turn hot focus onto this cause
INFJ|Yes. A stark and perfectly on target contrast that is emblematic of the system’s discrimination and corruption.
INFJ|Excited any time I get to have a long conversation w my friend, mentor, all around inspiring person @JonathanFPRose . A true visionary , champion of social , environmental sustainability. Tune in
INFJ|We need to #ProtecttheArctic now before it is too late. A new report from @ClimateCrisis lays out recommendations to address #climatechange and work to #ProtecttheArctic is front and center! #SolvingTheClimateCrisis
INFJ|Love to see an actual soldier, patriot and public servant tell the bratty cousin of the Pillsbury Dough Boy, @TuckerCarlson , to clam up. Truly, what has this guy ever done for this country other than vomit bile in public? We need more Tammy, less Tucker
INFJ|Yes , yes. @MichaelaCoel is off the chart great on all levels. Writing, actingall of it. 🔥
INFJ|@craigswhitney @MotherlessBKLYN What was the Kubrick reference you thought it was? So curious
INFJ|@craigswhitney @MotherlessBKLYN Actually it’s a very specific homage to a Vivian Meier image that Dick Pope , I loved. There are a number of recreations or homages to shots of hers in the film actually. Maybe we’ll discuss on @Criterion someday! Here’s her shot. 
INFJ|Whoa. @CharlesMBlow @NAACP you catch this one? More of Trump’s ‘very fine people on both sides’
INFJ|Ouch. But.yes.
INFJ|Make it fun, do what actors do and turn it into role-play. Pretend youre a ninja or a superheroor a spyor in the Walking Dead. And your deadly mission is like getting coffee without dying. Dont be a snowflake, bitching about something so easy!
INFJ|The virus isnt political , we need to drop the idea that a mask is, fast. Its about caring for each other , showing what Americans can do when we pull together. Its not that big an ask or an imposition. Its not the ONLY thing we need to do but it makes a difference.
INFJ|Now more than ever, we need to unlock the nonprofit sectors potential. Dan Pallottas new guide, The Everyday Philanthropist, is basic literacy for people serious about a better world. It reads in an hour and will change how you think about change. 
INFJ|If only this were satirical
INFJ|Talk about putting a spotlight on your own corrupt intentions. Thank you @senatemajldr @marcorubio @LindseyGrahamSC , the rest of you @GOP incompetents for underlining what stooges for our enemies you indeed are. We already know but nice of you to prove it yet again
INFJ|My bet is complicit , compromised. Thank you for calling it out bluntly Dr Barkhuff.
INFJ|A serious question for @JohnBrennan @LincolnsBible @GenMhayden @tedlieu @ProjectLincoln @ericgarland @SethAbramson @Comey or anyone else with insight how is it that US LE , IC let this remain under wraps while this bought, paid for, compromised asset ran for President?
INFJ|But how does it sit w the MAGA crowd that their Clown Emperor , his Marie Antoinette daughter literally wash the blood money of terrorists? Assisting those who murder Americans seems to be a consistent enterprise for the Trump mob.
INFJ|For those who haven’t read @adamdavidson terrific reporting on this in the New Yorker, he’s referencing the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. Let that sink in. We know they’ve been laundering money for the US mob since the 70’s , for Russian mobsters at least since 90’s
INFJ|👇🏼
INFJ|Exactly. Total BS. When impeachable incompetence is being proffered as rationale that is wasn’t outright treason, you know the wheels have totally come off the clown car.
INFJ|@AmbassadorRice @waltshaub We have to stop even passingly ascribing this to ‘incompetence’. He knew. He’s an owned , directed asset of our enemies, betraying our country at a level with no precedent in American history. He has always been, , continues to be, deployed to weaken the USA. He’s a traitor.
INFJ|@DARollins @waltshaub A person of color could reasonably fear ending up in a police chokehold for resisting or protesting at this level, even with a far more valid cause than this entitled twit. The double standards are grotesque, lethal , atrocious.
INFJ|Appalling. A middle finger to every effort to confront one of humanity’s greatest collective challenges. I agree with @elonmusk #DeleteFacebook
INFJ|@patrickc @NAChristakis Well said. Wouldn’t it be amazing to hear Mark Zuckerberg say ANYTHING that sounds like an authentic acknowledgement that the US system created the matrix of opportunity for him to build his company , that he’s committed to not letting that company be an instrument of harm to it?
INFJ|Yes. Thank you @tedlieu
INFJ|Who does it ultimately help to let corporations poison water more freely again? Republican voters get just as harmed, care about the health of their kids just as much. only helps #CorporateSocialists not competent enough to operate a business without socializing costs to us
INFJ|It’s only the rule of law on the line. @RepAdamSchiff @RepJerryNadler get going. Put Barr in a chair to answer questions , if he won’t, hold him in contempt , impeach. Barr = Rasputin. You can’t wait for an election when the crime is obstructing justice to affect that election
INFJ|@ewarren Yes, thank you. And how about investigating and impeaching? And what concrete actions can be engaged to stop massive voter suppression like we’re seeing in KY?
INFJ|Why isn’t this guy being subpoenaed by the House oversight process? Literally the walking embodiment of obstruction of justice in his every act. @RepAdamSchiff angry do nothing for us. Put him in the chair , if he doesn’t show out him in jail like anyone else
INFJ|GOP dismantling democracy in front of our eyes. @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi @RepAdamSchiff What the hell is being done about this? Georgia was the wake up call. Nobody can act surprised. What’s being done to stop this flagrant suppression?!
INFJ|Not acceptable.
INFJ|People who care about this country should read and repost this thread far and wide.
INFJ|This is an inspiring group of people doing work that’s more important than ever for NYC. Local heroes who give me hope. If you don’t know their work, read up , support them.
INFJ|@jack 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
INFJ|@hocoforjustice @BarackObama Wilde Lake High graduate here. Class of ‘87. K-12 in Columbia public schools. Proud as hell of you guys for your fire , determination. Jim Rouse (Columbia founder / social justice champion / my grandad) is smiling down on you. DM , tell me if you need help
INFJ|Since Cadet Bone Spurs Drumpf has no indepent knowledge or education as to the historical context of either, I smell Stephen Miller’s white supremacist hand all over it. I wonder if the #BunkerBabyInChief even gets told why he’s doing or just reads the teleprompter
INFJ|Be still, my heart. @waltshaub @SethAbramson give us the over/under if #MoscowMitch actually got dethroned like his doppelgänger Yertle the Turtle, how many weeks before he had a top executive position in the aluminum company of his handler Deripaska?
INFJ|Sharing this again. For those who are able, this is a great way to support multiple orgs doing important work to fight racism and promote law enforcement reform. 
INFJ|Offense on top of offense. This benefits nobody but corporations. It hurts humans of every political persuasion. Do Republicans want poisoned water , polluted air for thei kids? President Nixon established the EPA! It should be a point of pride for the GOP!
INFJ|she actually has such a limited sense of global history that she didn’t even realize she probably shouldn’t be frontwoman on a real estate partnership w oligarchs managing $ for the Iranian Revolutionary Guard 
INFJ|(BTW, she’d have to fake being offended by this comment bc she doesn’t know what any of these references mean, I assure you. Though presuming that’s she is qualified to represent the US in foreign affairs
INFJ|Who spliced the genomes of Eva Peron, Imelda Marcos, Marie Antoinette , Eva Braun to torture America w this toxic mannequin of vapid hypocrisy? @JuddApatow which SFX studio created this horrible joke gone awry?!
INFJ|Yes, it bothers me. Pretty much the definition of corruption.
INFJ|Somebody please ID this officer and promote him with thanks for his capacity to discern between criminals and citizens he’s committed to protecting.
INFJ|The Nazis, like every other gang of fascists thugs, really prided themselves on their crowd control tactics and resented their authority to beat up on people being questioned. Thank god patriots like my grandfather (Navy WW2) stood up to those sadistic madmen , their cult leader 
INFJ|Literally, what fascism looks like. As ever. The Brownshirts, just wearing blue. I don’t believe DC has an ‘open carry’ law does it? If not, then isn’t it illegal for someone with no legit LE or military insignia / ID to be intimidating citizens w assault weapons? Asking.
INFJ|Amen. And applicable to everything else we’re facing today. 
INFJ|#WorldEnvironmentDay
INFJ|even on World Environment Day. Peace, Love , Commitment to Engage Actively, EN
INFJ|Im proud to be on the Board of GoFundMe. We donated $500,000 to help kick off this campaign , were working to elevate it. I believe it supports specific organizations making a real difference in this fight. , I appreciate @antonioguterres posting this
INFJ|protect , serve each other , stand up to gross injustice. Everyone. I dont think my thoughts on this matter one iota more than anyone elses but I think it takes every single one of our voices to make our chorus loud , powerful enough to overmatch the bullies, thugs , cheats.
INFJ|But how can we get people to pull together to stop brutalizing the Environment of our planet if we cant even stop brutalizing each other? Right now, this must be the cause of the moment for America because we cannot unite to meet our many other challenges until we truly love,
INFJ|A global environmental threat looms over all of us. We are brutalizing the ecosystems that support our way of life , our economies, annihilating the innumerable species that live on the planet with us. This crisis isnt taking a pause , we must pull together to meet it.
INFJ|Constitutional right to legal protest , free expression, being beaten, pepper sprayed, run over by SUVs, tear-gassed (journalists as well) to realize that we are at real risk of authoritarian thugs destroying our great democratic experiment. The enemy is truly among us.
INFJ|diminishes us all. It shouldnt take witnessing the grotesque , appalling murders of unarmed black men jogging, reaching for their wallets, selling cigarettes, black women sleeping in their beds to become enraged enough to act, to protest. Nor seeing Americans, exercising the
INFJ|how shockingly prevalent it is, how violently it expresses itself, how much damage it does to our friends, our brothers , sisters our countrymen , women who experience it, how it woven into our social structure , economy, both by intention , by default. It shames us all
INFJ|and Ill share some posts on that following this. But it would be emotionally dishonest , difficult it is right now to detach from full engagement with the emotional, political, social urgency of the confrontation our country is having with the deep, ugly truth of racism..
INFJ|Ive been proud to serve as the UN Goodwill Ambassador for Biodiversity for many years now and, today being #WorldEnvironmentDay w this years specific theme being Biodiversity deserves focus , attention as we face up to our ever-intensifying climate / ecological crisis..
INFJ|Perfect
INFJ|I had a great conversation w @UNESCO in @UNESCOCourier about how we fight for our planet , a sustainable future, despite so much bad news. I meant to post it on International Biodiversity day but now that World Environment Day is approaching, here it is 
INFJ|People still taking lazy shots at treehuggers are probably really lousy at basic economics or else just #CorporateSocialists who want to keep privatizing profits , socializing costs to the rest of us. Half our economy is inextricably dependent on sustaining ecological systems
INFJ|#CorporateSocialists
INFJ|Bravo
INFJ|And all because his little snowflake ego couldn’t handle a few jokes at his expense at the WH Correspondent’s Dinner.
INFJ|@PGourevitch In your terrific book ‘We Regret to Inform’, I recall that mention of suspicions that mass shipments of weapons used by genocidal militias were coordinated by Jean-Christophe Mitterrand, son of the former Pres of France. Was this, or involvement of French govt, ever confirmed?
INFJ|A very astute articulation of the cultural component of the challenge we’re facing
INFJ|Correct.
INFJ|He’s literally an asset. Just not one owned by the USA.
INFJ|@NickKristof @paulkrugman Jeez, @senatemajldr #MoscowMitch , states like NY paying more in taxes than we get back in benefits, KY getting more than you payredistribution of wealth based on needthat sounds an awful lot likeSocialism. Look in the mirror, you’re a card carrying member!
INFJ|And Arnold shares his favorite movie that he’s rented so far in quarantine 😎. Tune in
INFJ|We talked about how Arnold , I first met (he told me my 4 hour a day workout regime for American History X was ‘pretty wimpy’), why we believe moments like this crisis need all of us to pitch in , how the support for #FrontlineRespondersFund is really making a difference
INFJ|I’ll be on @jimmykimmel show this evening w @Schwarzenegger , my muscular / awesome partner in setting up the #FrontlineRespondersFund It was a great talk even if JK does look like Wolfman Jack dressed up as Lucy from the Peanuts , Arnold brought a donkey , pony to the table
INFJ|@JohnFugelsang @THR Batman but not Chinatown? Sorry, no. Reds missing too.
INFJ|But not for his corporate pals of course because bankruptcy might wipe out the equity of management when they had to get recapitalized, which is called ‘the hazard of the market’. 
INFJ|Because of Covid-19, Earth Day this year has been rescheduled for Tuesday, Nov 3rd.at a polling place near you.
INFJ|This is easy to do as an act of solidarity with each other and our planet on Earth Day. If we don’t make noise and out a stop to these practices we’ll repeat this painful experiences.
INFJ|This Earth Day it seems especially important to acknowledge that global failure to respect , care for biodiversity , the heedless destruction of the complex ecosystems of our planet has direct links to our current pandemic crisis. Here’s something we can unite around
INFJ|Thank you so much to the nearly 20,000 people who have donated. And we’re not stopping because the need isn’t even close to over.
INFJ|Look at these numbers. This is why we leaned in to support this critical effort to accelerate the shipments of PPE. Procurement has been challenging but also not enough. The logjam was in the logistics of moving it, with hospitals facing huge delays.
INFJ|Sunday night movie and a bottle of this sounds good to me! Nice idea, guys!
INFJ|Feel like some great live music today? Check out #LiveFromQuarantine starting 2pm today. I’ll be introducing a cool magic interlude by my pal @davidblaine $1 being donated to #FrontlineRespondersFund for every viewer who signs in! 
INFJ|This is very well-articulated breakdown of timeline of Covid-19 in the US that dispels notions of it circulating in the US earlier than February , that we’re closer to herd immunity than we are
INFJ|Yes
INFJ|Yes. Thank you.
INFJ|Huge thanks to @austinbis , @magicgiant for organizing some Sunday music with a purpose 
INFJ|This wonderful group of musicians has organized a virtual festival this afternoon to benefit our #FrontlineRespondersFund to help accelerate the delivery of critical protective gear to heroic hospital teams. I’ll say hi , give update at the top. 2pm PST 
INFJ|‘Our’? Who the F is ‘our’? I’ve only got a BA in History but should some of us get together , explain to this epic dipshit, slumlord, grifter, bestie-of-psychopathic murderers, in his Alex P Keaton ‘does it make me look like a grownup?’ suit how Federalism actually works? Clown
INFJ|This is awesome @wearfigs donating $1 to our #FrontlineRespondersFund for every repost of this below. Or just use #FIGSxDoctorsDay. Let’s rally! Repost and share! Thanks!
INFJ|All of us want to support our heroic frontline medical teams who are protecting us. This is a VERY effective way to get the desperately needed PPE gear to the teams that need it urgently. Let’s show them the love! #FrontlineFund 
INFJ|Thank you. Let’s not fail to mention too that the Fed has just made it possible for these companies to tap debt at the lowest rates in modern history. Let em live or die by the free market that’s what they get paid big bucks for being so adept at, right? #CorporateSocialists
INFJ|Yes
INFJ|Couldn’t agree more. @ystrickler nails so many of the hidden mechanisms through which we’ve impoverished people, our communal cultural experience and our environment while calling it ‘growth’ when it was financial maximization for very few. Such an illuminating / inspiring read
INFJ|From one of the most notorious , shamefully arrogant architects of the crony capitalism that has created massive wealth inequality and socialization of corporate losses, EVER. Sit down and be quiet, hypocrite.
INFJ|And while you’re at it PLEASE mandate paid sick leave for all companies doing Biz in NY. We have @UPS @FedEx package handlers and delivery folks working very sick for fear of being fired , denied on sick leave requests. BE TOUGH! Tell companies we’ll shut them down! Shame them!
INFJ|100% correct @AOC @NYGovCuomo @SenSchumer @NYCMayor We need immediate , real protection from rent , mortgage, residential , commercial. Working families , small business can’t be expected to keep landlords , huge commercial real estate barons , and the banks behind them afloat
INFJ|Absolutely f-in not. This guy got wealthy setting up a systematic foreclosure scheme at his bank that drove thousands of working Americans, including many military veterans, out of their homes over technicalities in the wake of the last financial crisis. Crony capitalist.
INFJ|Can we please explain that the danger they’re in is the hazard of the ‘free market’ the GOP loves to worship and that if we tax-payers bail them out it makes THEM the biggest Socialists in America? And that we’ll only give it in exchange for all the shares of senior management?
INFJ|That’s called extortion. Hey @AOC, since these guys used $3bil off the tax breaks the GOP gave them to buy back stock and enrich themselves rather than make sure their company could survive volatility without destroying their blameless workers
INFJ|@sacca Just kicked in $2500. Let’s rally.
INFJ|This seems like another excellent effort to move critical protective gear to hospital teams. Thanks @typesfast. Kicking in now. Close friends are ER Docs in the Bronx , in San Diego. Let’s get them what they need to stay healthy , keep saving lives
INFJ|This seems like one excellent campaign to me Help Hourly Workers During The Coronavirus Crisis 
INFJ|It’s going to take a lot of creativity , fast adaptation to figure out the most effective ways for those with the means (big or small) to help others who are suffering big setbacks.
INFJ|Seems important to share this widely because millions of Americans will be very worried about this. Please share widely @AOC @ewarren @BarackObama @tedlieu @RepAdamSchiff @JoeBiden please expand on this issue , give guidance. 
INFJ|to prevent panic , default , gives good guidance on how to correctly communicate to a lender about financial stress from this situation triggering their requirement to forebear or adjust the obligation until situation changes.
INFJ|For working people understandably concerned about being able to meet mortgage payments if their income is being totally disrupted by the Covid shutdown, this article contains really important detail about new protections being put in place 
INFJ|I second that. @davidfrum Who would actually have jurisdiction over that? Does the crime of trading on ‘non public information’ include information not specifically about a given company? Is this an SEC matter or is it unethical but not a specific statutory violation?
INFJ|@MarkRuffalo @HBO Cannot wait to see this, pal. Anything you’re in, I’m there!
INFJ|Helpful tips on how to help others for those who can
INFJ|But since those kind of community classes ain’t the smart move in defense of community health right now the teachers there, being the flexible (ha ha) , caring folks they are have come up with these LiveStream classes. I’ll be on the feed. Come join , drain some stress together! 
INFJ|One of my regular ‘reset buttons’ for personal health , sanity is @ModoYoga. Love their studios, classes , teachers. @ModoYogaNYC @ModoYogaLA always leave me heading into the day w better energy, which we all need now 
INFJ|Absolutely correct

INFJ|No matter what your political leanings, read that sentence ‘Amazon doesn’t have to pay federal taxes’ and tell me that makes sense to you in consideration of all the struggling, hard-working Americans who pay their taxes.
INFJ|A clip worth watching this evening
INFJ|But I agree that one of the most valuable (maybe ONLY) opportunities in awards, too often wasted, is to elevate great work that’s under-appreciated, to encourage the wider audience to explore beyond the familiar , find delight, emotion , meaning in new voices, places , stories.
INFJ|The memory of who, or what, won awards fades in 24 hours and often can’t be recalled at all within a week. Being a part of great work, great collaboration, is the highest privilege , is what actually confers the real reward the elevated opportunity to work again.
INFJ|Brilliant is right. Inspiring, original, hilarious, boldall words I’d apply too. I voted for all four of ‘the family’ , Cho Yeo-Jeong too. But it doesn’t really matter. Great art that actually has something to say transcends, rises , endures.
INFJ|Worth watching UNSecGen @antonioguterres discusses climate crisis w young activists. Young people all over the world are rightly recognizing that climate crisis is the defining issue of our era , that their future is under threat

INFJ|I assume most people know by now that @KenBurns is one of Americas greatest filmmakers , an inspiration to anyone working to tell complex stories in a compelling way. But in case youre not tuned into his latest magnum opus, check it out immediately 
INFJ|The pace of the fall is making me miss the drift of summer. Endless thanks to the good people @mercedesbenz for letting us road test this #NewVClass made us feel like locals for a while

INFJ|And the trailer dropsvery soon 😎
INFJ|So great to see the @WSL stepping up to act on the climate crisis w commitment to go carbon neutral , to refuse single-serve plastic , leave every beach better than they found it. #StopTrashingWaves. Make your pledge and learn more at @wslpure
INFJ|Another applause worthy move by @WSL . setting a standard other sports leagues should be trying to match. Very proud that @MaasaiWild and our Chyulu Carbon project are a partner in generating the carbon credits WSL is using to offset travel.
INFJ|Kudos to @wsl . Every sports league should be making these kinds of moves
INFJ|and only give our $ to companies and brands that totally align their business model with sustainability.
INFJ|To my mind, there is not a single challenge facing humanity more urgent than the challenge of altering our own unsustainable behavior as a species. Not one. This is our defining, generational cause. Lets vote only for leaders who commit to this agenda on a policy level
INFJ|The ecosystems that support us are in dire crisis and the magical diversity of life, within which we only dimly grasp our dependency, is being decimated.
INFJ|A thought on International Day for Biodiversity The delusion that the Natural world has limitless abundance for humans to draw on must now be judged not just wrong-headed but an unforgivable and immoral assault on the quality of life for future generations. 
INFJ|Friends in Europe This exhibition is REALLY worth checking out. #AnthropoceneProject @EdwardBurtynsky Stunning photographs depicting the impacts of human activity on our planet. Beautiful and alarming at the same time. Cant recommend highly enough

INFJ|I first read about Ricky Jay in this great profile I then ran to sign up as a volunteer usher for his show RJ , his 52 Assistants. I ushered for it at least a dozen times , was mesmerized every time. He called me on stage once for one of the bits

INFJ|on the planet. The risks associated with immigration of desperate people to our shores are paltry , easily borne. The risks to our national character from rationalizing brutality , racist xenophobia are fundamental. My grandfather served in the Navy in WW2, my father was a
INFJ|or from Jesus admonition that as you do unto the least among you, you do unto methese draconian cruelties do violence to Americas values, Christian values, humanitarian values , and erode our claim to being the land of the free. Were the most powerful , richest nation..
INFJ|of separating migrant parents , children at our borders. Whether viewed from the perspective of due process within the rule of law, the broader values , character of a nation that, from inception, was built by , welcomed immigrants with words enshrined on our Statue of Liberty

INFJ|@briankoppelman But also one of my favorite modern master, Jacques Audiard has done 4 greats in a row ‘The Beat My Heart Skipped’, ‘A Prophet’, ‘Rust and Bone’. Then ‘Deepan’ won the Palme D’Or (I just haven’t seen it yet).

INFJ|@NYCCouncil @deBlasioNYC the bill youre considering to block @UberNYC is backed by taxi fleet owners not drivers or residents. NY knows it
INFJ|@NYCCouncil @deBlasioNYC find one single @UberNYC driver who would go back to driving taxi You cant. Youre defending taxi fleet slumlords
INFJ|@NYCCouncil @deBlasioNYC no New Yorker prefers taxi model 2 @UberNYC but you move to constrict positive change bc taxi fleets give $$ SHAME
INFJ|@NYCCouncil @deBlasioNYC 4 out 5 cab rides Im in the driver is on phone, speeding , rude if you ask them to stop. We all know this.
INFJ|@NYCCouncil @deBlasioNYC taxi fleet owners inflict crappy economics for drivers who then inflict horrible service , poor safety on riders
INFJ|@NYCCouncil @deBlasioNYC youre fighting for an industry that creates abusive indentured servitude for its drivers, gives them no equity
INFJ|@NYCCouncil @deBlasioNYC no NY Taxi offers a car pool option to reduce traffic. no NY Taxi offers recourse when a driver is on their phone
INFJ|@NYCCouncil @deBlasioNYC who would defend utterly horrendous service , moribund biz model of NY Taxis against good service , efficiency?
INFJ|@NYCCouncil is considering a bill that threatens to destroy 10,000 NYC job opportunities. @deBlasioNYC, oppose ban on new @UberNYC cars

INFP|Great! Ill see you at Bestival! @NMEmagazine
INFP|@NMEmagazine have you heard the Omar Soleyman remix and what do you think?
INFP|@NMEmagazine Im chuffed by your interest. Thank you very much. Can I ask you a question?
INFP|@NMEmagazine orchestra in Indonesia, hopefully before I die.
INFP|@NMEmagazine my old celeste and gave bronze notes (like the Gamalan) so its a hybrid. But I would love to get to sing with a gamalan
INFP|@NMEmagazine I also wanted it to be something which you could connect with a touchscreen for kids to play with so in the end we gutted
INFP|@NMEmagazine didnt feel right. I guess because Volta was an anthropology project and this project is more about science.
INFP|@NMEmagazine I heard gamalan music first as a teenager, I thought of going to indonesia for this project and recording there but it
INFP|@NMEmagazine attached to any model.
INFP|@NMEmagazine by it are the time signatures of the song. Mostly prime numbers. But I did it in a more impulsive way so its not rigidly
INFP|@NMEmagazine I did read a book about him and think about using it, but I didnt in the end. The only thing thats slightly influenced
INFP|@NMEmagazine themselves.
INFP|@NMEmagazine these formats are made by humans to make it easier for humans to do their thing so more variety will help more people express
INFP|@NMEmagazine is invented cause they think it will erase the previous one, but at the end of the day they all coexist. At the end of the day
INFP|@NMEmagazine for sure, I think its similar to the telephone or radio or film and video. People got scared when the new thing
INFP|@NMEmagazine they want. They dont have to buy everything!
INFP|@NMEmagazine that it can both stand on its own, or be connected to apps. Its your choice. I like to encourage the fans to buy only what
INFP|@NMEmagazine no, because the album for me is still the most important component. Ive tried the hardest I can to make the album in a way..
INFP|@NMEmagazine working with people like Michel Gondry.
INFP|@NMEmagazine so Id like to take it as it comes. In a way, the apps are a more natural visual to the project than videos. But I love..
INFP|@NMEmagazine I dont know. We are improvising. Id like to think that putting music out online could we spontaneous
INFP|@NMEmagazine or, a lightning base-line, or make a structure of a song with different crystals.
INFP|@NMEmagazine I decided to pick the most simple one, and the one that a child could get. For example pendulum base-line
INFP|@NMEmagazine which is matched with acoustic instruments.
INFP|@NMEmagazine its the touchscreen. So nature is in algorithms inside the touchscreen which you play with a finger..
INFP|@NMEmagazine so the acoustic, electronic and nature are together. Its the same for this project except the touching point is different.
INFP|@NMEmagazine where I distorted electronic beats to sound like volcanic eruptions and string octet together
INFP|@NMEmagazine Ive always been interested in it, and Ive explored this before with songs like homogenic
INFP|@NMEmagazine yep!

INFP|Just type repent, heretic. Fewer characters and itll have exactly the same effect on me. 
INFP|@RuwaydaMustafah Very strange, isnt it?
INFP|Cis is ideological language, signifying belief in the unfalsifiable concept of gender identity. You have a perfect right to believe in unprovable essences that may or may not match the sexed body, but the rest of us have a right to disagree, and to refuse to adopt your jargon.
INFP|@JennyGlover40 @WildWomyn Happy birthday, Jenny 🔥
INFP|Mesh surgery women not given accurate advice, says report. 
INFP|@katerackham That’s absolutely wonderful. Sending you and your girls love and healing vibes xxx
INFP|Never forget its far too unsafe for trans women to use mens bathrooms/changing rooms, because they might get assaulted. However, its completely fine for any man who identifies as a woman to use womens bathrooms/changing rooms, because rapists will rape women anyway. 
INFP|@TheRealLindaK Cant wait x
INFP|@TheRealLindaK Winnies Wisdom is perfect. What could be better?
INFP|@Nephentes5 @DutchLGB Those books saved me, too. I think this makes us cousins x
INFP|@DutchLGB None of us are responsible for the actions of those who share a few characteristics with us. I went into this with my eyes open, I knew what was coming and its certainly not your fault that it came! You owe me no apologies at all - and Im truly glad about the magic ❤️
INFP|Threatening to murder women completely fine. Accurately sexing rapists hate crime.
INFP|Man no definition needed. Non-man (formerly known as woman) a being definable only by reference to the male. An absence, a vacuum where theres no man-ness. 
INFP|@TullipR 👏👏👏
INFP|What face will you make when God brings up your ? 
INFP|@ImWatson91 Now you suggest it, Im tempted to pen a few verses and have them bound in velvet for a few dear friends.
INFP|Im not ashamed to admit I shed a tear. 
INFP|@Jozinhagirl @cazadams58 @francesweetman I hear some women saying they dont understand - five minutes ago a lot of these men understood enough to parrot feminist lines about consent and rape culture. Now theyre telling women they dont have the right to male-free spaces or female-only care. The masks have dropped.
INFP|@Chris98133703 @Maria01953500 @RTHG82 
INFP|@Maria01953500 @RTHG82 I was wrong, it wasnt over four years, it was three. 
INFP|@dobleplusungood @francesweetman This has been a litmus test for decency in men like none Ive ever seen before.
INFP|You don’t think females needing intimate care should feel safe receiving it? Or that women self-excluding themselves from medical care, on religious grounds of because of past trauma, is any kind of issue? And the 6500 rapes that have happened in UK hospitals over a 4 year period - not a biggie? It’s overly idealistic to care about these things, is it?
INFP|@francesweetman Every man who supports this should be asked, ‘have you always been keen on removing safeguarding for women and girls, or did you get interested when an ideology came along that gave you cover?’ IMO, most are in the first group. They just couldn’t say it.
INFP|@RTHG82 And how does women’s safety, privacy and dignity impact any of those things? Will there be more beds if women are forced to accept intimate care from men? Will more lives be saved if all wards are mixed? 
INFP|@RTHG82 Are you more upset that I’m not currently in need of hospitalisation, or that I care about women having safety, privacy and dignity when they’re at their most vulnerable, Ross?

INFP|@TwisterFilm @MaryHowden @Telegraph I have a feeling she chose her pseudonym very carefully and I honour her for it.
INFP|@MaryHowden @TwisterFilm @Telegraph He would!
INFP|@TwisterFilm @Telegraph I think its kind of nice. Strike would be fine with it.

INFP|@SarahVaci @ImWatson91 Ah, Id love to see that. Your works fantastic, Sarah.
INFP|@RadfemBlack @FiLiAcharity Things can be arranged 😉
INFP|@femmb @RadfemBlack Tithing is the whole basis of my cult, Jennifer, and dont pretend you didnt know, because I wrote out the cheque myself for you to sign, but I seem to remember your pen didnt work. #excommunicated
INFP|@KristofferPhilp @RadfemBlack This is so disappointing, Kristoffer. Just when wed got rid of all your Engrams, too.
INFP|@RadfemBlack @FiLiAcharity I have an in 😉
INFP|@peakedspeak @RadfemBlack Best offer Ive had so far. Youre now second in command of the cult and when I ascend to heaven, you get my fifty-two husbands (whether you want them or not) and the prophecies Ive written in Pig Latin on a matchbox Ive lost.
INFP|@rutheday99 @RadfemBlack I only ever give four word slogans to villains. Makes you think
INFP|@LGB @RadfemBlack Which reminds me, someone needs to organise a laundry rota. Some of the togas are getting really grubby and I will not countenance sweatpants. This isnt a bloody spin class.
INFP|@colwight @RadfemBlack I cant help feeling a proper cult leader would be getting a lot more contrition, Colin. Hard not to suspect the radical feminists I sent round to rough you up skipped the punishment beating and went to the pub. Again.
INFP|@SinclairJM1987 @RadfemBlack Well, dont blame me if you go to hell, Sheridan. I tried to show you a better way.
INFP|@RadfemBlack Im such a crap cult leader. Im not even convinced youre all sending me 10% of your earnings. Last months cheque barely covered dog food.
INFP|@ImWatson91 There will be no dickheads at my party. My parties are dickhead-free zones.
INFP|@ImWatson91 He will meet me again, because theres a party. Will DM you both about the party xxx
INFP|@ImWatson91 @JenniferLahl Camerons lovely. You chose a goodun.
INFP|@ImWatson91 Cameron is a wise man and you should listen to him.
INFP|@ImWatson91 Stunning, but I met you without make up and you were beautiful then, too. Fwiw, pictures arent ever really representative of who we are, theyre pictures, not manifestos. Sometimes its ok just to think yeah, I rock a scarlet lip, if you do. And you do xxx
INFP|I thought this was a parody account. Its not. 
INFP|@CJMurrumbeena @solveig283 @ISangHolyHoly @toddtempleman @billybragg Name the attributes, dont give vague categories. What, specifically, is a female emotional attribute? Whats a female physical attribute?
INFP|@CJMurrumbeena @solveig283 @ISangHolyHoly @toddtempleman @billybragg And what are these female attributes?
INFP|@PLopezD @KinjouNanaho ❤️
INFP|I will defend free speech for all views  post-colonial theory as much as gender critical feminism. Free speech for just one side is not free speech at all. Free speech for all sides benefits all sides. 
INFP|Genuine grounds for optimism for everyone who cares about academic freedom and free speech. 
INFP|@colwight @NeurolawGuy @billybragg Ive met cleverer teacups.
INFP|@FKASerioJosh Same vibe as ‘I’m praying for you’, once said to me through clenched teeth by an American Christian fundamentalist who was of the Potter-is-Satanic school of thought.
INFP|@francesweetman I was was thinking that the other night, when I was treated to the philosophical musings of someone whose bio reads ‘adult human urinal’.
INFP|@FKASerioJosh Always. I’d mention beards, but you and my husband have both got beards, so #NotAllBeards
INFP|This is said constantly of women who’ve paid a heavy price for speaking out. ‘She can’t have suffered, she’s still speaking.’ What they mean, of course, is ‘suffered enough.’ 
INFP|You deserve an honest answer to that question (and thank you for the nice comments). When a man asserts that lesbianism is ‘a sensibility at odds with women’s biological reality’, what does that say about his view of women’s bodies? That the ‘biological reality’ of the female body is dependent on its owner having sex with men? Are we less real, or less female, if men aren’t reaping sexual pleasure from our bodies? That’s profoundly offensive to any woman who hasn’t signed up to the idea that women aren’t definable except by the most regressive stereotypes ever seen outside a Busby Berkley musical. (I suspect, though, that Bragg couldn’t really explain what he was saying. He just thought it sounded clever and pressed send.)
INFP|Saying lesbians have a sensibility at odds with their biological reality may be the most homophobic and misogynist thing @billybraggs tweeted yet, which is a high bar. But in answer to your question, Billy If a man can be a woman, theres no such thing as a woman. 
INFP|@Partta Robin mounts a defence in the book, though I admit Strikes not convinced.
INFP|@QueenMaureenGC And so true, if youve genuinely got a conscience.
INFP|@Liberalbstard I used to write lines like that just to relieve my feelings.
INFP|@JillBorland Sooooo many brilliant Wodehouse lines. One of my very favourites is It is never difficult to distinguish between with a Scotsman with a grievance and a ray of sunshine.
INFP|@RickValens1 God, thats good. I need to reread Watership Down.
INFP|@Jakkiell And Alcott was so angry at having to marry Jo off, she gave her a husband she knew none of her Laurie-loving fans would like.
INFP|@SarahJaneOmega Ive just finished writing a chapter and this makes me very happy indeed. Thank you x
INFP|@Alright1973 The Book of Moron.
INFP|@happyrachy Good old Robert. He could have written that line about times in my life.
INFP|@SarahJaneOmega Where on earth did you read that?
INFP|@Ankis1988 I read that aged thirteen and I remember a) gasping and b) the hair on the back of my neck standing up.
INFP|@MartinB00383268 Amen. One to cut all of us down to size.
INFP|@RosarybeadJones So beautiful. Middlemarch has got so many lines and scenes that linger in my memory. Eliot was a genius at evoking visual images.
INFP|@KymOShea1 One for the ages, but particularly the age were passing through now.
INFP|@lyndacoote The last page of a Tale of Two Cities is one of the few I cant read, even on its own, without crying.
INFP|Elinor agreed to it all, for she did not think he deserved the compliment of rational opposition. - Sense and Sensibility
INFP|@FKASerioJosh @TheRealLindaK I’m about to start writing after a night of broken sleep. Let’s check notes on productivity at the end of the day.
INFP|I’m so proud to call the brave and brilliant @Docstockk a friend. 
INFP|@FKASerioJosh I’m definitely not, but you’re very funny 😘
INFP|@TheRealLindaK @FKASerioJosh I noticed both those things!
INFP|@FKASerioJosh I instinctively got that it was in the Jenna Marbles/Julian Somalita sense.
INFP|@ZumGee @arbuthnotting Would read.
INFP|@francesweetman If the lefts ever scored a bigger own goal than saying child safeguarding, womens rights and free speech are far-right issues, Ive never seen it. The idiots pushing this line are going to find it takes a lot of living down.
INFP|@ivybelle1 @arbuthnotting Exactly!
INFP|@arbuthnotting That made me laugh. I always think under the guillotine sounds as though the person was standing beneath the platform the guillotine was on, and died of unrelated causes.
INFP|@BabyJaysGhost Then you were very close to where my parents met for the first time!
INFP|@Dotdarling68 They say karmas a bitch, but I hear shes a TERF.
INFP|@tomboytalia Face it, being called a Nazi by this crowd is like being called a lizard mutant from the plant Zorb. Lets both be careful to keep hiding our imaginary tails from those whore onto us.
INFP|You lie and smear, assuming youll live out your days as a hanging judge and never find yourself in the dock. No cultural moment lasts forever. Yesterdays fanatics realise they joined the wrong mob. Populist movements shrivel and fall apart. Robespierre ended on the guillotine. 
INFP|@paulbam3 @sassycarrie What he says in the video does not support the allegation. Swear in the bloke in the car - swear in someone who insists their poodle can dance the samba, for all I care. True or false, the testimony would be equally worthless. Neither prove the allegation.
INFP|@sassycarrie Thats not how this works, as surely even you know. You dont get to publish a libel then say prove what Im saying isnt true. The burden of proof is on the person making the statement. You havent provided a shred of evidence for your claim, just published another libel.
INFP|@sassycarrie You cant honestly believe this would be considered proof of your allegation that feminists invited Nazis to a Let Women Speak event, in a court of law? Footage of a man sitting in a car making an un-evidenced claim about an unidentifed conservative group?
INFP|@lovearran @sassycarrie Sassy, like most of the people making these libellous claims, is so used to operating in a fact-free zone that she imagines making baseless assertions will always be consequence-free.
INFP|@sassycarrie Provide the evidence for this serious allegation that the Nazis were invited there by feminists. Show us the proof.
INFP|@angijones @PatrickStrud Full solidarity with you, Angie x
INFP|@karenregardless @LuxuryMoon @PatrickStrud Hes going to need a support herd.
INFP|@MrMenno @LuxuryMoon @PatrickStrud Do it!
INFP|@Ron4California @DTCahill @PatrickStrud When you assert that something happened that demonstrably didnt happen, it cant be defended as an opinion. Its a lie.
INFP|@aminaerin1 @PatrickStrud My days of arguing with drunks are long since over. Run along.
INFP|As @PatrickStrud has blocked me on here (weve never, to my knowledge, interacted on Twitter or anywhere else) I cant challenge him directly about the claim he published in iNews that a Let Women Speak event in Australia staged a mass Nazi salute. This is a lie so brazen, so easily disprovable and so libellous, Im amazed it was allowed into print by a supposedly reputable news source. For years now, women and gay people concerned about the erosion of their rights, the dismantling of safeguarding and the escalating threats and violence of trans activists have been called fascists and Nazis by people like Strudwick for holding what, until five minutes ago, were solidly left-wing/feminist political positions. Nobody but useful idiots can be genuinely surprised that REAL fascists have spotted a glorious opportunity in trans activism. The homophobic, anti-feminist far-right has long held that the left is degenerate, foolish, immoral and authoritarian, and now they can point to the incoherent arguments of the gender ideologues, the bullying tactics of the no-platformers and the swarms of masked men threatening violence against women for wanting to retain single-sex spaces, and crow we told you so. Actual Nazis have turned up on the fringes of Let Women Speak events for exactly the same reason aggressive, narcissistic trans activists are there. These groups closely resemble each other. Both are rife with misogynistic opportunists whore using a clash of rights to push their own agendas, both are there in the hope of violence, and neither gives a damn about the women whore there to speak out in their own voices, about their own lives, on their own behalf. Its high time those peddling lies like Strudwicks are held accountable and I sincerely hope @ThePosieParker takes action.
INFP|@JohnJamesNI @PatrickStrud The women who call rape survivors Nazis for wanting penis-free spaces make my skin crawl, too. This whole debacle has been a fiesta of skin crawling.
INFP|@theSpectacle @helenstaniland @LuxuryMoon @PatrickStrud Me.
INFP|@LuxuryMoon @PatrickStrud But as Ive already told her, she knows where I am.

INFP|You assert that charities keep most of the donations for themselves. I cover 100% of the core costs of @lumos, so that all public donations go directly to help vulnerable children. I doubt any of this compares to your own philanthropic efforts. Just thought Id mention it. 2/2 
INFP|For the last twenty-three years Ive had a charitable trust that focuses on alleviating social deprivation. Details here All my royalties from The Ickabog were donated to the trust to help those hardest hit by Covid, both in the UK and abroad. 1/2

INFP|@berylperrol @lumos @ilporticolondon It is 😊
INFP|@ilporticolondon Not a patch on yours, my friend xxx
INFP|Anyway, I cant decide. So all four of you can have dinner for four at @ilporticolondon on me. Im about to follow you on here and we can fix things up! And thank you to everyone who tweeted their excellent and sometimes bonkers suggestions x
INFP|.@MaryHowdens story idea is also excellent. Strained relations ensue could be the blurb on every Strike novel, after all 
INFP|I like @Andi72s plot very much, even though it isnt the story in The Running Grave. 
INFP|This one from @HelenHighwatr made me laugh, though let me emphasise, I do not find the Norfolk accent impenetrable. Please dont send me letters. 
INFP|At the top of the wishful thinking category comes @LudicrousMonicas tweet. Something with truffles and they still dont kiss. Wonderful. 
INFP|This has been a VERY difficult decision. The shortlist for the About To Get A Free Meal For Four At @ilporticolondon is as follows

INFP|@nomorelittlewh1 @lumos @ilporticolondon Wow, is all I can say to that. Wow.

INFP|@B74368049Steven @lumos @ilporticolondon They broke his restaurants windows for the crime of raising money to get vulnerable children out of the path of the war, so Im going to have to answer no to that one.
INFP|James owns one of the best Italian restaurants in London. He hosted a dinner last year to raise funds for my charity @lumoss work in Ukraine, for which hes been targeted by trans activists ever since. The next bits for Strike fans @ilporticolondon features in the next Strike novel, #TheRunningGrave (James didnt know this, it was supposed to be a surprise, but hey ho). Tweet me your most entertaining (or accurate, or insightful, or amusingly bonkers) predictions for what happens in #TheRunningGrave and Ill buy the author of the winning tweet dinner at @ilportico for themselves and three guests. Ill also pay for your travel if youre outside London. And youre allowed to buy all the most expensive stuff, including champagne (even though Strike doesnt like it.) Let the games begin. Deadline will be 10pm UK time.
INFP|@sueveneer It is indeed. #TheRunningGrave

INFP|Trying to decide between different proposed covers for your new novel? Heres a good tip ask family members which one they prefer. Theyll vehemently disagree and youll end up so confused you no longer know what you like and let your editor choose 👍
INFP|@LindsayMLand The only way to know for sure whether Strike would like it is for you to send it to me so I can eat all of it. (He does have cake in #TheRunningGrave).
INFP|@VineMissde Ah, I wish I could tell you. Just be careful down there. You never know who - or what - you might meet.
INFP|@LittleHardman @funkgodartist And Ill write the blurb, photocopy it and send it back the original😉
INFP|@BelfastBeatnik Thank you so much x
INFP|@LittleHardman @funkgodartist Id buy it.

INFP|@LeGripNegatif Send her my love 🩷
INFP|@Casualnaming My all-time favourite, which I wish Id saved, was one where the sender had ill-advisedly strayed from the template, and called his imaginary child (who cries for ten minutes every time I tweet) a son and then a daughter within the same tweet. #transphobic
INFP|@tielrex Say happy Mothers Day to your mum from me! x
INFP|My one-year-old son just looked up from Twitter and said, Mummy, why have you made these very real children sad with your heinous yet unevidenced bigotry? Then he ran upstairs and burned all his Potter books. I was so damn ashamed I almost forgot the kid was imaginary. 
INFP|For voicing my concerns about gender-affirming care for minors, I have been called a transphobic bigot. If that’s what speaking out against the medicalisation of homosexuality makes me, then so be it. @benappel, on the new homophobia.

INFP|No, I think therell be ten Strike , Robin books, so youve still got a few to go!
INFP|I often get asked this. The honest answer is that youll enjoy it more if youve read the first six, because youll be much more invested in the two main characters and their story arc. However, each book is a standalone story.

INFP|@helensaxby11 @bandwildyouth If it’s a crime to think a particular song didn’t deserve to win the Eurovision Song Contest, I’d have been sentenced to life in year deliberately omitted.
INFP|For those confused as to why Ian Banham was fired and publicly lambasted by @bandwildyouth, here’s one of his ‘horrifying’ . His crime is standing against the insanity of pretending knife-wielding rapists are women if they say they are. 
INFP|The re-traumatisation of female rape survivors, including this man’s victims, on seeing him called a woman by the press counts for nothing, naturally. The so-called kindness and inclusivity of @bandwildyouth is preening, self-satisfied misogyny. #IStandWithIanBanham

INFP|Entertained by the idea that women who assert the importance of biological sex are talking in ‘largely academic terms.’ Isn’t ‘lived experience’ the gold standard before which all other data must bow? Or is it only possible for a woman to experience her life if she’s got a penis?

INFP|@AustinRSheridan The laughing emoji, the sly smirk emoji and the mention of transphobes, a mere forty-eight hours after a highly publicised mass attack on women, at which at least one was punched, absolutely confirm that this was entirely about your desire for tomato soup, Austin.

INFP|@BrianSpanner1 Yes. Yes, he is.
INFP|Every word of this. 🧵
INFP|There are multiple videos of Kellie-Jay being assaulted. Women have become used to lies, threats of violence and outright denial of reality, but if you imagine anyone feels defeated, think again. Your mens rights activists showed the world exactly who they are. #LetWomenSpeak
INFP|4. If you dont believe convicted double rapist Isla Bryson is a genuine trans woman, youre admitting that predators can and do manipulate the current Scottish system. Yet you and @HumzaYousaf voted to strengthen such mens ability to do so. 3/3
INFP|3. You voted for a bill that means any Scottish male can, without surgery, hormones or psychiatric assessment, and even if hes been convicted of rape, apply to become a woman under the law. You say this couldnt possibly be abused. 2/3 
INFP|.@glasgowcathcart 1. There is zero evidence that trans-identified males dont retain male patterns of criminality. 2. There are proportionately more trans-identified males in jail in the UK for sex offences than among male prisoners as a whole. 1/3
INFP|@iquischnox @glasgowcathcart @HumzaYousaf All of those issues have been campaigned for by prison reformers and feminists for many, many years.
INFP|@LiterallyCanada @glasgowcathcart @HumzaYousaf Id love to see evidence of that claim. While were waiting, heres some reading for you. 
INFP|6. Lastly, do you and @HumzaYousaf believe legislation that enables fully intact males with a history of sexual violence to apply for a gender recognition certificate comes with no risk to vulnerable women and girls? I await your answers with the liveliest interest. 3/X
INFP|3. Do you agree with @HumzaYousaf that Bryson is not a genuine trans woman? 4. How would the pair of you define a genuine trans woman? 5. How would you both test for the genuineness of a trans woman, given that your legislation removed all medical safeguarding? 2/3
INFP|Some questions for @glasgowcathcart 1. Is the be-penised rapist you coyly call the individual a man or a woman? 2. Do you agree with @HumzaYousaf that convicted rapists should NOT be excluded from applying for a gender recognition certificate? 1/3

INFP|But @NicolaSturgeons made it very clear that every womans group and safeguarding expert raising concerns about her supposedly progressive agenda is a bigot. What can possibly have changed? Surely not her cast iron principles? 
INFP|A she-problem women being terrified of being locked up with male rapists, murderers and domestic abusers. This, you compare this to your irrational fear of spiders. 
INFP|@ChevellePhreak one short step below it was a slap, not a punch. Thats not real violence.
INFP|A woman lived in justified terror of violence and rape because shed been locked in with a male murderer and a male abuser of women. She had an invasive medical procedure she didnt want in case she was made pregnant against her will. Literally nothing happened. 
INFP|Same shit, different century. 
INFP|Female ex-prisoner in Scotland describes the daily reality of being forced to share shower areas and cells with trans women convicted of domestic abuse and murder. This is the very definition of cruel and degrading punishment.

INFP|This is Tiffany Scott 
INFP|A highly disturbed prisoner who has attacked female staff during time in prison, has admitted stalking a young girl and has been one of the most menacing people inside Scottish jails is to be moved to a women’s prison 1/2 
INFP|The Party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. It was their final, most essential command. George Orwell, 1984 4/X
INFP|Never forget, Sturgeon, her government and supporters have insisted that it is ludicrous to imagine anyone would dress in women’s clothes to get access to vulnerable women and girls. Wouldn’t happen. Everyone is who they say they are. To question this is hate. 3/4
INFP|However, trans woman and paedophile Katie Dolatowski, who covertly filmed a 12-year-old and attempted to rape a 10-year-old, both offences committed in women’s public bathrooms, IS a woman and remains in the women’s prison from which Adam Graham is to be removed. 2/4 
INFP|So in @NicolaSturgeon’s Scotland, trans women AREN’T women if they’re convicted double rapists, like Adam ‘Isla Bryson’ Graham. 1/4 
INFP|Still reading. The whole transcript (which has been approved by both parties) can be found at 8/
INFP|Can a charity representing gay, lesbian and bisexual people be criticised for pointing out that puberty blockers may lead to life-changing consequences? Dr Bell Well, yes, but it might lead to a - you know, I dont know, falling off the planet or something - whatever. 7/ 
INFP|Dr Bell yet again Mermaids dont engage with the Gender Identity Development Service (ie, medical clinic), but also engage with them about once a year. 6/ 
INFP|Btw, heres GIDS whistleblower Dr Kirsty Entwistle Pressure from families for medication grew. Those who’d connected with Mermaids were terrified, because they’d been told that their child was going to kill themselves if they didn’t get blockers. 5/ 
INFP|Dr Belinda Bell again. We dont give advice on medical stuff its not part of what we do, very explicitly. See just two of the former CEOs . 4/ 
INFP|Also Dr Belinda Bell, on the overrepresentation of gay boys and girls at gender clinics. I wouldnt agree that thats necessarily a worry that we dont understand. Theres a lot in the world that I dont understand. 3/ 
INFP|Take this, from Mermaids Chair of Trustees Dr Belinda Bell Well, you see, Im not clear people come out of the womb with a sex, to be honest. 2/ 
INFP|🧵Im reading the transcript of the tribunal of Mermaids v LGB Alliance. Its a bit mind-blowing, seeing some of the answers set down in black and white. 1/
INFP|@epilepticme I’m so happy you’re getting treatment at the ARC! They’re truly wonderful there. This comes with lots of love and hope that remission’s right round the corner. ❤️
INFP|@RCaron67 I liked yours and I won’t apologise for it either.
INFP|@bindelj That distant sound you can hear is an army of Twiglet munchers (not a euphemism) marching steadily towards you.
INFP|Men defining what a woman is, what women should and shouldn’t fear, what women should and shouldn’t say, what rights women should be fine with giving up and, of course, what constitutes ‘real’ misogyny get a bloody mirror. That’s real misogyny, looking right back at you.
INFP|Rosie Duffield, an ex-assistant teacher, single mother and survivor of domestic abuse, won @UKLabour a seat they thought was unwinnable. Post-Corbyn, she was returned to parliament with an increased majority. This is how Labour repays her.

INFP|@HaydenHewitt @RosieDuffield @DreyfusJames Its costing me a fortune in tips, but will he listen? No. And then he expects me to ring up about his lost pants.

INFP|@bindelj He didnt come cheap, and finding out what seat you were in took ages, but I see its going to be worth it.
INFP|A strange new form of temporary blindness has broken out among Scottish politicians. None of them could read placards calling for violence against women while standing inches away from them, yet they were instantly cured when photos of them posing with the signs hit the press. 
INFP|Fight that FOMO, bro. 
INFP|@BlakeVarga Youre very welcome 😘
INFP|Sturgeon is making a big mistake in thinking that by denying science and trashing women’s rights she looks progressive, because the public are smarter than that women won’t forget what she’s done, and they won’t forgive. 
INFP|The charmer whos been publicly advocating for a car to be driven into Posie Parkers rally, whos posted recordings of himself saying he wants to kill Rosie Duffield with a gun and me with a hammer, appears to have been identified. Social medias fun til it isnt, eh, brave boy?

INFP|@BipolarRunner @HeavenlyMalbec @DreyfusJames 😂
INFP|@ElleMcIvor @DreyfusJames But Im guessing youre not threatening them with death or rape, or posting faked evidence of what theyve said or done. In other words, youre still in the ring.
INFP|@JustinBustin420 @DreyfusJames Ah, but I wrote Harry Potter. Lion gt, snake.
INFP|@BipolarRunner @HeavenlyMalbec @DreyfusJames I wouldnt got that far 😉 But you send one of mine to the hospital, expect a trip to casualty yourself.
INFP|@DreyfusJames Its not fair, hes LOADS bigger than me, and I only ran up to him and kicked him in the balls. If you want Queensberry rules, you need to keep inside the ring, and if you want kudos without consequences, pick on a lower weight category.🤷‍♀️
INFP|@saramos5415 No need to wrap, just send him straight to Scotland as he is 💞
INFP|@Remussed @CormStrikeFan I realised Id done that one before (or very similar), so thought @CormStrikeFan deserved something NEW!

INFP|Anyway, I suppose I should now go and put on my wellies, or at least change out of my pyjamas. Thank you for letting me share this moment of euphoria, which I dont intend to damage by doing any re-reading until tomorrow, and I hope youre having as good a day as I am ✍️💫
INFP|I think I remember most of the days this has happened to me. I wrote Harrys first ever Quidditch match in a single afternoon and barely changed it afterwards. You feel elated afterwards, as though something took you over for a while, then dropped you back to earth.
INFP|Days like this, where writings a pure rush, make up for all those where youre rewriting and revising and trying to make gold out of what you fear might be lead (and sometimes is). Of course, Ill have to revise everything Ive done in the last seven hours, but who cares?
INFP|I know I should be out in the fresh air and the beautiful snowy landscape, but is there anything better than bashing out thousands of words - not all of which are crap - in a single sitting because your brains on fire and youve got to get the story down fast? No, there isnt.

You were the one who dragged his lawyer into this so, by all means, lets go to lawyers. 3/3
INFP|@josephjames94 @LeftyUnwoke youve published defamatory statements about me and are compounding the offence by saying Im encouraging the eradication of a group of vulnerable people.

INFP|@josephjames94 @LeftyUnwoke JJ, if anybody close to you had your best interests at heart, theyd strongly advise you not to keep handing my lawyers ammunition.

INFP|For weeks Ive been thinking if I can just get to the end of part six of the book before Christmas I can relax, and an hour ago I GOT TO THE END OF PART SIX. Then I looked round at all the tidying that needs doing and the presents that need wrapping and Ive started part seven.

INFP|@ImWatson91 Nearly as handsome as youre beautiful ❤️
INFP|If feminists are right, then women’s sex-based rights and the safeguarding of vulnerable children hang in the balance. If we are wrong, then our concerns deserve to be refuted with evidence. Either way the public deserve an open and sensible debate. 
INFP|Why on earth would you wish to make it easier for men to ‘abuse a system to attack women’? At some point even a first minister as stubborn and intellectually incurious as Nicola Sturgeon will have to answer. by @alexmassie

INFP|.@gameonterfs Nice profile pic, bro. 
INFP|Id say this is unbelievable, but of course it isnt. When our First Minister attends an event about male violence towards women and girls, the last thing she wants is some uppity woman mentioning the importance of female-only refuges or crisis centres.

INFP|@ImWatson91 You arent alone, Sinead, I promise. Many, many people see the need to help and support you and are determined to do so. You shouldnt have to do so much heavy lifting when youre struggling. Youre brave and compassionate, but its ok to let others pick up the baton for a bit.

INFP|.@NicolaSturgeon continues to ignore public opposition and seeks to push through the Gender Recognition Reform Bill in under two weeks, demonstrating once again that she prioritises the approval of lobby groups over Scottish voters concerns. 1/2

INFP|More appalling, heartbreaking news from Iran. #MahsaAmini #femicide #IranRevolution2022
INFP|👏 👏 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
INFP|No, Laura, the matter isnt closed. You havent retracted or apologised for your original assertion that I asked/demanded that the SoA put out a statement mentioning me alongside Salman. On the contrary, youve just repeated it. Twitter is evidently not the place to resolve this. 
INFP|@RachelCDailey Shes just repeated her accusation. Try and keep up.
INFP|Defamation is not free speech. I did not ask to be included in the statement made by the SoA after the attack on Salman, nor do I believe asking Twitter support to take down an account telling me youre next was wrong. I await your apology and retraction. 5/5
INFP|You made a false, extremely unpleasant allegation from behind a block and are now complaining that it got sufficient traction that I saw it. I would have been able to address you directly or privately had you not blocked me. We both retain our free speech. 4/5 
INFP|I did not tweet about Harriss poll. Nor did I comment on Harriss long, self-indulgent thread about her own problems with stalkers and fans, immediately after the attack on Rushdie. I did ask Twitter support for help with one of several death threats I received that day. 3/5 
INFP|Now you use the weasel words or maybe your followers focus. In the immediate aftermath of Salmans attempted murder, @joannechocolat, the president of the SoA, tweeted a flippant poll about death threats to authors. This was seen by some as a veiled dig at me. 2/5 
INFP|As @TinyWriterLaura still has me blocked, I can only respond to her here. Ive never asked the Society of Authors to issue any statement concerning me, whether by tweet, email or letter. Youve just repeated the accusation that I asked the SoA to issue a statement. False. 1/5 
INFP|@OliverFindlay @TinyWriterLaura Im sure it will be, but the request for an apology and retraction stands and shell need to unblock me so I can see it. Alternatively, she can just show me her evidence that I demanded to be included in the statement.
INFP|Should be included in, not included on, of course, but I bet even professional proof readers miss stuff when theyre seriously pissed off.
INFP|I let 99.9% of bonkers lies about me on Twitter glide past for the sake of my own sanity, but alleging I tried to capitalise on the stabbing of somebody I know, and whos long been a hero to me, crosses a line. An apology and a retraction seems in order. 2/2
INFP|Could somebody not blocked by writer and journalist @TinyWriterLaura (shes blocked me) please ask her to show her evidence that Ive ever demanded to be included on any Society of Authors official statement, let alone one about the attempted murder of Salman Rushdie? 1/2 
INFP|@blablafishcakes Not a word of it, and the proofs on Twitter for all to see. Its a truly vile thing to say, though.
INFP|The right side of history scrawls death and rape threats inside a female students bathroom in Mexico. Male violence against women in Mexico is among the highest in the world.

INFP|@rtaskeeter @JKRsBarmyBooks I discovered Charlotte Mew while doing my Victorian readfest and shes a definite exception to the rule, I love her work and now own all her poems. I also love Christina Rossetti, as youll probably have gathered because I took the title of the first Strike from her.
INFP|@0PantheraTigris @CormStrikeFan @JKRsBarmyBooks Dont worry, hes not built to be skinny!
INFP|@JKRsBarmyBooks I cant promise he wont make any more lousy emotional choices going forwards, but the IBH is a watershed moment for him. Something fundamental has changed. Its just a shame (for him) it took him this long!
INFP|@JKRsBarmyBooks I think hes broken in ways he doesnt want to deal with, which makes him compartmentalise to an extent thats increasingly damaging (to himself as well as others) and unsustainable.
INFP|@JKRsBarmyBooks I think Strike mounts his own best defence while hes thinking about Madeline, while in the car with Robin. He thinks that people use each other all the time - which wouldnt be my personal view, but its his best means of justifying his own behaviour to himself.
INFP|@JKRsBarmyBooks Went to get myself a cup of tea and missed this! So - great question, but a little black and white. Has he used women? Definitely, though only once did the woman realise she was being used (Nina) and she had it out with him, too. Is he a good man? Id say hes a flawed good man.
INFP|@JKRsBarmyBooks ❤️
INFP|@JKRsBarmyBooks That was wonderful! Thanks to all of you! 🖤
INFP|@JKRsBBAWestMids @JKRsBarmyBooks Patience, is all I can say right now. Have patience!
INFP|@robinloveSEDA @JKRsBarmyBooks Happy relationships make bad fiction. Rest assured, I have a plan.
INFP|@gbjeffen @JKRsBarmyBooks Yes, yes, yes, well spotted! Theres a definite Aurora Leigh connection, all the way to Zoe/Marian Erle.
INFP|@JKRsBarmyBooks Ah, THAT question. Well Strikes now FINALLY admitted to himself how he feels, while Robins telling herself she needs to stop feeling what SHE feels in short, I wouldnt expect this to happen immediately. But Im not saying never!
INFP|@MDayCassandra @JKRsBarmyBooks You want me to do a Hitchcock? Actually, the producer did suggest I sit in the background in a pub scene one time, when I was watching filming, but I really hate seeing myself on screen so it would ruin my enjoyment of watching the finished series!
INFP|@JKRsBBAWestMids @JKRsBarmyBooks You are dangerous and should be stopped.
INFP|@Rosanne58550352 @JKRsBarmyBooks a) I cant act b) Id just keep corpsing c) and even though hes extremely professional, I think he would, too, watching me trying to deal with a cockatoo while delivering lines.
INFP|@CormStrikeFan @JKRsBarmyBooks Which is exactly how I spent my last birthday but one. Took the family to Highgate Cemetery (3rd visit for me, 1st for kids) because I needed to check something for the book and knew they had to humour me that day, at least.
INFP|@JKRsBarmyBooks hahaha, Midge is young, very physically fit and hot. I think I should slap on a wig and play Pat.
INFP|@badlywired @TheSEFilesPod @missedith01 @JKRsBarmyBooks There you go! My oldest friend is a veteran (I did not base Strike on him, I must add, hes a happily married man and dissimilar in many other ways), but hes definitely got that mixture of compassion and practicality.
INFP|@LindsayMLand @JKRsBarmyBooks You meet her in the next one and youre right to like her.
INFP|@WackyPidgeon @JKRsBarmyBooks 😂
INFP|@JKRsBarmyBooks Somebody (not Robin) does suggest therapy to him in the next book!
INFP|@FeelsAndOTPs @JKRsBarmyBooks Definitely.
INFP|@CormStrikeFan @JKRsBarmyBooks Ive got bad news for you. Youd better smoke all you can before now and the publication of the next one!
INFP|@JKRsBarmyBooks I was reading so many Victorian female poets to put me in the mindset and I joked to a friend of mine they had only 3 subjects Lo, behold the bumble bee, Woe is me, the babys dead and God, thou art stern but will save us.
INFP|@JKRsBarmyBooks And this brought me back to the Victorian romanticisation of sickness and death, which in a very strange way connected to some of what I saw on Tumblr. I saw definite parallels between Victorian attitudes and modern ones.
INFP|@JKRsBarmyBooks He reaches a crisis in this book and is forced up against some hard facts change your lifestyle, or your career’s over. And his health crisis mirrors his emotional crisis. He’s voluntarily lived in denial about his feelings for Robin and change is forced upon him there, too.
INFP|@JKRsBarmyBooks but there was a sickness in the online refuge they found, too. And then youve got the more literal illnesses and disabilities in the book, people struggling with the daily reality of chronic illness, pain and so on, not least Strike.
INFP|@JKRsBarmyBooks Most were looking for those things that keep anomie at bay - community, friendship, a hobby – and there’s nothing ignoble about wanting those things, we all need them. Yet things have become toxic inside the game they thought they’d found an escape from the real world
INFP|@JKRsBarmyBooks real life friends, family, sense of purpose, meaningful work and so on. Then you’ve got obsession, which when extreme can become mental illness. In the mods of the game, we have a group of individuals who’ve latched on to TIBH and whose obsession becomes central to their lives.
INFP|@JKRsBarmyBooks This is a biggie. The central theme of TIBH is sickness. At the (dark) heart is anomie, a sickness of disconnection, the kind of amoral nihilism you find in people who find no place for themselves in any of the sustaining things that keep human beings grounded –
INFP|@missedith01 @JKRsBarmyBooks V important character moment for Strike. Army, isnt it? I know a few veterans. Theyd do that, no bother, and not make the recipient feel embarrassed about it, either.
INFP|@0PantheraTigris @JKRsBarmyBooks You know, its funny (, this has happened to me countless times), I didnt know what Drek was until I was some way into writing the book. I conjured him back to front and had to work it out like Strike - oh, of course, hes got the scythe (nose), hes got the black cloak - duh.
INFP|@gbjeffen @JKRsBarmyBooks Its a reverse image of Silkworm in some ways. This time, the killer isnt a creator, though we surmise theyd like to be.
INFP|.@JKRsBBAWestMids John Boyne said something very interesting about that in a recent interview. He said particularly vicious trolls really do want their victims to die, that theyre locked into that online game mentality where the more kills you get, the quicker you level up.
INFP|@missedith01 @JKRsBarmyBooks Such a perfect way of putting it. Mortality and illness are central to this book. Its really impossible to visit Highgate Cemetery and not ponder your own mortality. The very air smells of death - bones, anyway.
INFP|.@ForWomenScot Thats the conundrum, isnt it? Both human and less than human. What I found interesting about this particular killer was that they had a degree of insight into their own malaise, as Robin spotted from the start. Why call yourself Anomie?
INFP|@JKRsBarmyBooks Youre right this book deals with death on many levels. Death of conscience. Death of the creator. Death of a community, because what happens in the book breaks apart something that had once been happy and sustaining.
INFP|@erkstagwitch @kitten1805 @JKRsBarmyBooks I adore Pat. She was inspired by an older woman I knew, now sadly deceased, who was very funny, very judgemental and at bottom, incredibly kind.
INFP|@robinloveSEDA @JKRsBarmyBooks Thats such a nice thing to say. I was trying to explore the full gamut of obsessive fandom through the moderators of the game. Some were there in search of a refuge, an escape from their own troubled lives. I empathise strongly with that.
INFP|@FrenchFem @JKRsBarmyBooks That IS a compliment!
INFP|.@mwmairi Thats something thats always fascinated me. Even before I was published, in youth, Id meet people (often fans of rock bands) who seemed to feel they were somehow also in the band, that they should be making key decisions and so on.
INFP|@missedith01 @JKRsBarmyBooks Funnily enough (and I do mean funnily) if Id copied and pasted from what I get sent, nobody would have believed half of it - at least, not the people who arent on Twitter!
INFP|@gbjeffen @JKRsBarmyBooks No, I always planned cold case, THEN an internet-based case. I wanted a complete contrast, something (almost) bang up to date.
INFP|.@CormStrikeFan Order out of chaos. PD James said something so brilliant every single time, a little catharsis. Theres the satisfaction of trying to solve (or construct) the puzzle, but I love the genre because you can do so much with it. And I love world building!
INFP|@erkstagwitch @JKRsBarmyBooks Thats such a lovely comment. I really did work hard to capture the tone and flavour of different online communities. Id never been on Tumblr before, for instance. That was a HUGE education.
INFP|@CormStrikeFan @JKRsBarmyBooks Probably (by a whisker) Troubled Blood. Only just. I have to say, Im loving the current one.
INFP|2015 was actually a significant year for terrorist incidents against art exhibitions, which was something else I wanted to wind into the book. What art (both high and low) signifies and why some really want to destroy it.
INFP|@JKRsBarmyBooks Although the subject under discussion intruded itself upon my notice in my mentions on here, sad to say.
INFP|@JKRsBarmyBooks Everyones too freaked out to answer! I empathise I went to some odd corners of the internet, researching this book.
INFP|@JKRsBarmyBooks Thrilled to be here!
INFP|@JKRsBarmyBooks See you there!
INFP|The international community has to stand with the women of Iran. This is femicide. #MahsaAmini
INFP|Ill never know anyone remotely like Robbie again. He was an incredible talent, a complete one off, and I was beyond fortunate to know him, work with him and laugh my head off with him. I send my love and deepest condolences to his family, above all his children. 
INFP|@billybragg Self respect? From the guy who tried to use the holocaust to attack feminists? Women standing up for their rights receive constant threats of sexual violence. Some have lost jobs and been attacked at protests. Good to know you and Norton are OK with the culture, though 👍
INFP|@ArtyBagger Love you, Mu xxx
INFP|You’ve compared feminists to Nazi eugenicists, Billy. You agreed with @grahnort that cancel culture is merely ‘accountability’. Do you believe threats of rape and murder are acceptable ‘accountability’?
INFP|@millenialkez You’ve made my day ❤️
INFP|@varindeus @evakurilova You are such a Ravenclaw. I could spot it a mile off.
INFP|@elniedunne Ah, that makes me SO HAPPY!
INFP|@GraemeJenkinson That’s genuinely the most amazing thing I could ever hear. Send him massive love from me!
INFP|I read my most recent royalty cheques and find the pain goes away pretty quickly. 
INFP|Hard to think of anything that better illustrates misogyny than men complaining that a woman has a view on woman’s rights.
INFP|@cjohio I like beards. I just dont like them when theyre attached to misogynists.
INFP|Very much enjoying the recent spate of bearded men stepping confidently onto their soapboxes to define what a woman is and throw their support behind rape and death threats to those who dare disagree. You may mock, but takes real bravery to come out as an Old Testament prophet.
INFP|Still not enough. There is literally nothing he could do that could make right what he put those families through - but I hope this breaks him.
INFP|Thank you! Personally, Im grateful to all academics whore standing up for freedom of speech and thought at a time when both are under attack. Im proud to stand with you and your continued commitment to the values of the Scottish Enlightenment.
INFP|@francesweetman Wow, we have so many mutuals!
INFP|@Scriptman1963 I’m so happy to hear that! I think Troubled Blood is the best one yet. Four parts, out in December I think.
INFP|Rational acknowledging the possibility that men might claim a female identity to escape the draft. Hateful saying some men claim a female identity to get easy access to vulnerable women and girls. via @amermilnews
INFP|@ItsPaoloni Fair.
INFP|I cant lie, I just laughed so loudly I scared the dogs. 
INFP|I understand why some people are questioning whether this is true. The comment below was posted by a detransitioner I know in real life and whose truthfulness and integrity I can vouch for. 
INFP|I read this two days ago and I can honestly say not an hour has gone by since that I havent thought about it.
INFP|I know there’s a redundant a in the previous tweet. I’m in a car on a bumpy road. I’m also bloody livid.
INFP|Oh, I’m sure the First Feminist will be all over it, what with her a sterling record of taking women’s concerns seriously and loudly condemning rape and death threats to members of her own party.
INFP|Nicola Sturgeon’s Scotland a place where an Equalities Officer feels free to declare in public how much he wants to beat up non-compliant women. SNP equalities officer threatened to beat the f out of terfs in abusive - Daily Record 
INFP|The apology and recognition was of the utmost importance… given the way in which her legally held views had been vilified. she had been unfairly and unlawfully ‘de-platformed’ in a publicly hostile manner which was damaging and humiliating. 
INFP|It would be hugely surprising if some who believe self-ID to be the wrong way forward did not launch legal action. @euanmccolm on @NicolaSturgeons push to force through self-ID in Scotland, over the protest of grassroots feminist organisations. 
INFP|.@DreyfusJames Happy birthday you magnificent man. xxxxx

INFP|@RealBenSibley This is where I draw the line. I dont even like Rolos.
INFP|@Tachardiella @TheRealFarRigh1 @JamesEsses @GPair10 People who believe their tribe could never, under any circumstances, make a mistake, are dangerous.
INFP|@francesweetman The crazy thing about this is, its all been documented virtually minute to minute. Future historians wont be struggling to find out how this cultural moment happened think how many books, blogs, videos, speeches and documentaries will be available to them.
INFP|I say this as someone whos been on the liberal left all her adult life own goals dont come any more spectacular than if you care about child safeguarding you must be right wing.
INFP|An important win for freedom of speech and a reminder that however much some would like to censor and silence feminist groups and speakers, the latter have the law on their side. #WorthyOfRespect #FreedomOfSpeech
INFP|And as if you needed telling, you rock too, @Daleythompson, especially for the way youve raised your voice in defence of womens sport. Thank you.
INFP|This letter perfectly expresses the fury and determination of the Scottish women currently fighting to be heard by their government. Its addressed to our first female First Minister, @NicolaSturgeon. I sincerely hope she reads it. #WomenDeserveBetter #WomenWontWheesht
INFP|@judgejules75 Love to all of you! 💜🤍💚
INFP|We must see justice for #MahsaAmini, #NikaShakarami and all Iranian women currently being killed, beaten and raped for standing up for their human rights. This is femicide.
INFP|PS Ive just found out the trust, which was at just over £70m, is currently slightly below, but thats Liz Trusss fault, not mine.
INFP|and yes, Ive poured time and money into a 17-year-and-counting campaign to ending child institutionalisation with @lumos. However, I accept that my efforts are pitiful compared to the critical humanitarian work of calling women TERFs all day on Twitter. #humbled #inspired 2/2
INFP|Today in my mentions I learn that I never cared about womens rights or child protection until the last couple of years. True, in 2000 I established the Volant Charitable Trust which is now worth £70m, to focus on womens and childrens issues, 1/2
INFP|@judgejules75 @ForWomenScot Big ❤️ to both of you!
INFP|@DarcyWAHF @ForWomenScot Guilty of wearing a dangerous T-shirt, huh? Well, women’s words ARE ‘literal violence’ 😘
INFP|I stand in solidarity with @ForWomenScot and all women protesting and speaking outside the Scottish parliament. #NoToSelfID 
INFP|This fantastic 🧵 explains why women in Scotland are standing up. #WomensRally #WomensRights #WomenWontWheesht
INFP|Perfect example. The problem isnt that a man who wrote sympathetically about orgasming on or with a child was made trustee of a childrens charity, but that the TERFs might twist his appointment. Then straight back to the self-soothing mantras, with a glow of inner virtue. 
INFP|@JoeGayHistorian No, thank you. People like you remind me how many wonderful allies there are out there xxx
INFP|@jayrotoole You are straw manning in an attempt to deflect blame from a movement that is kinder to rapists than women and more protective of big pharma than vulnerable children. Literally nobody here is disagreeing that most trans people are decent. The paedophile apologist isnt trans.
INFP|@ATRward1349 Again, Andrew which minority are you talking about?
INFP|For the legions of the blocked. 
INFP|India, I swear to God, if you want to start a petition for Mermaids to take me on in court, the first signature will be mine.
INFP|@ATRward1349 Which minority group is this, Andrew? The pharmaceutical companies and doctors raking in cash? The queer theorists indifferent to real world consequences of dismantling safeguarding? Or are you defending PhD students who write papers on orgasming on or with children?
INFP|You still prefer wilful blindness and four word mantras to considering you might have got this badly wrong. You became part of an authoritarian, misogynist, homophobic movement and you didnt even notice. Enjoy the sense of your own righteousness while you can. It wont last. 3/3
INFP|when you shrugged off masked men roughing up lesbian protestors and tried to shout down detransitioners talking about what was done to them by ideologically-captured doctors. Women, gay people and vulnerable kids have suffered real harm and you? You cheered it all on. 2/3
INFP|I note the genderists are now arguing that it doesnt matter that a paedophilia apologist was a trustee of a trans childrens charity, because he was only one. You know, I thought things were pretty bad when you were arguing to put convicted rapists in womens jails, 1/3
INFP|@babooshka2002 @MermaidsGender I would urge you to read what hes actually written if you believe his aim is to prevent paedophiles offending rather than normalising and destigmatising paedophiliac desires/behaviours.
INFP|Teenaged girls are mounting an attack on a misogynistic, authoritarian regime. Their bravery is simply astounding. #MahsaAmini

INFP|@kellywhite2 I’m so sorry for your loss. I’ve seen this reaction to female-specific trauma time and again. All ‘lived experience’ is held sacred by the genderists except that of women, whose pain is minimised, jeered at or framed as a self-serving lie. Misogyny 101.
INFP|@MrSanity @francesweetman Because Im not scared of cenobites 😉
INFP|@francesweetman You know the box in Hellraiser? That.
INFP|@francesweetman Nah, Ive seen crazier. As Mermaids defenders go, shes only about halfway up the league table. Some of our biggest names still havent thrown their hats into the ring, so I think that coveted top spots wide open.
INFP|If Id been arguing for the destigmatisation of paedophilia ten years ago, had never recanted those views and then wheedled my way onto the board of a charity for vulnerable kids, then damn right I should be fired.
INFP|When you appoint a trustee to a childrens charity, you do due diligence. A simple google search would have enabled Mermaids to read Breslows own words. Either they did literally no checking, or they were fine with his views. Either way, its a catastrophic safeguarding failure.
INFP|Thats pretty damn optimistic of you, Twitter. 
INFP|@dip89dw And I wouldnt need a whole gnats worth.
INFP|Read something else then, you muppet.
INFP|I think societal contempt for mothers has been particularly obvious around the issue of child transition, but it must be said that men have also been threatened and bullied for speaking out. Ive seen gay men being absolutely monstered for raising their concerns around Mermaids.
INFP|So I dont doubt that there are some panicky phone calls being placed to PR people by certain corporations and celebrities right now, but as they remain completely insulated from the severe harm theyve enabled, my sympathy can be measured in gnats thimbles. 5/X
INFP|Theyve been allowed into classrooms, trained police and had unprecedented influence over health policy, even though by their own admission they arent a medical charity. Weve also found out theyre sending devices to flatten breasts to underage girls w/o parental consent. 4/5
INFP|They couldnt have achieved it without the money and public support of certain corporations and celebrities, who eagerly boosted them even though the red flags have been there for years. Mermaids fingers were all over the Tavistock Gender Identity Clinic debacle. 3/5
INFP|Weve now learned that Mermaids appointed a paedophilia apologist as Trustee and that their online moderator encouraged kids to move onto a platform notorious for sexual exploitation. This is a charity thats achieved unprecedented influence in the UK. 2/5
INFP|Deleted last tweet because I was writing a thread and accidentally posted the last one first 1/5
INFP|@bindelj @blablafishcakes you are effing kidding me.
INFP|Tell me again how the parents, teachers, medics, psychiatrists, safeguarding experts and prominent members of the gay rights movement whove been trying to raise the alarm about @MermaidsGender are bigots trying to foment moral panic. 
INFP|@francesweetman Worse. Far, far worse.
INFP|Imprisoned for eating breakfast while being female. The Iranian regime needs to knows the world is watching. Donya is just one of the women who’ve been jailed or killed for not wearing the hijab in the wake of #MahsaAmini ‘s death at the hands of morality police.
INFP|If youve found yourself on the opposite side to Fred Sergeant, I would respectfully suggest you can kiss goodbye to being on the right side of history. 
INFP|@teresacbab This makes me very, very happy 😘🖤
INFP|Listen with the sound up. Their voices ❤️ #MahsaAmini
INFP|.@ryanjohnbutcher Fibbing about what I said on the very platform where people can check the truth in seconds seems weird, but then you realise the tweeter is the multi award-winning head of news at Pink News and inhale half your coffee up your nose again. 
INFP|Millions of us stand with these women. The Iranian regime must be held accountable for its femicide.
INFP|@grannyparcel @simonjedge I knew I liked you 🦁♌️
INFP|@ImWatson91 nooooooooo, Im so sorry!
INFP|@Lungbarrow1 
INFP|@harlequinpub now youre making me want another JKR!
INFP|@GraceShoreBanks You know, like all very private individuals have.
INFP|@simonjedge 🤣Then I have questions about their business model
INFP|@simonjedge I cant stop laughing.
INFP|@bindelj @benjamincohen You should mention that more often. I had no idea.
INFP|@whoisthiswomann @benjamincohen I truly hope the same for you. So many of us are with you ❤️
INFP|Funniest thing Ive read all week. Your clickbait comic can barely go 10 minutes without mentioning me @benjamincohen and Ive never once complained, yet one factual tweet and you scream persecution. Obvs factual reporting not your thing, but Dec 2019 isnt many years ago.
INFP|@Annie30365678 Im so, so sorry. Other people (parents and young people who were groomed/met potential groomers online) have told me the same story.
INFP|@CaresDonley Im so sorry, thats dreadful.
INFP|.@benjamincohen (whose husband was a Mermaids trustee) may disagree that @MermaidsGenders extraordinary influence over healthcare and education is long overdue for scrutiny, but to some of us, the recent explosion of journalistic investigation is entirely welcome. 5/5
INFP|In 2021, the NCOSE put Discord on its Dirty Dozen List, an annual campaign naming entities that profit from and facilitate sexual exploitation. 4/5
INFP|Here are some of the incidents arising out of adult contact with minors on Discord, as reported by the National Center on Sexual Exploitation. 3/5 
INFP|The @MermaidsGender moderators only note of caution to the children on the Mermaids forum was that they shouldnt use the name Mermaids for their Discord group. 2/5 
INFP|For those who havent read the Times article, a moderator on the @MermaidsGender forum encouraged gender questioning children to move their discussion off the Mermaids forum and onto Discord, a platform notorious for hosting graphic content and failing to verify user ages. 1/5
INFP|@ClaireColemanE @SinclairJM1987 Congratulations!
INFP|@spamisnotham @billypilgrim85 @SinclairJM1987 They dont make my top 5.
INFP|@billypilgrim85 @SinclairJM1987 Twiglets! I knew Id forgotten something.
INFP|@yeahrig14483328 @SinclairJM1987 Macallan. Its Friday night and I just finished a chapter 🎉
INFP|@SinclairJM1987 Im drinking whisky and Ill try, honest.
INFP|The unspeakable bravery of these Iranian women. Murdered because they refused to be constrained and controlled by men. #MahsaAmini
INFP|I stand with all Iranian women silenced by a misogynistic, authoritarian regime. We must be their voice. #MahsaAmini
INFP|This is horrifying. The Iranian regime continues to slaughter women. #MahsaAmini
INFP|Ive just gone to look it up. Eleven people claimed to have seen the plates, some of them related to Smith, but theres debate as to whether this was a metaphysical experience or they genuinely saw them. And one man was allowed to hold the box but not look inside it.
INFP|Im now being told that lots of people saw the golden plates. Im genuinely fascinated how many people?
INFP|Exclusive Trans charity Mermaids to be investigated by Charity Commission 
INFP|Its like when Joseph Smith found the golden plates and nobody else was allowed to look at them. 
INFP|@dobleplusungood @trashalou @TheFamousArtBR @bindelj Definitely pro.
INFP|@bindelj @WomanForWomen2 Tragic to see a former friend radicalised online in this manner. I trust my passive-aggressive injunction to learn and grow will be the end of the matter, Julie. Youll feel better for it. In peace 🕊️ #Quavers
INFP|@bindelj Wait until Thirder News gets off the ground. Therell be a pro-crisps editorial every third week and a daily feature called Bindelwatch.
INFP|@bindelj Pink News will be thrilled to have them 😉
INFP|@DuskyPat @bindelj You are very dangerous and must be stopped.
INFP|@bindelj For that, I hope he pulls out a pack of Cheesy Wotsits next. #IStandWithMe
INFP|@dobleplusungood @trashalou @TheFamousArtBR @bindelj Thats exactly why I love them.
INFP|@billypilgrim85 @trashalou @TheFamousArtBR @bindelj Try them again, Bobby. Just believe.
INFP|@KingFacetixus @trashalou @TheFamousArtBR @bindelj Yes, Ive got some in the cupboard right now, but theyre in lowly bags, not festive tubs.
INFP|@BlueMeanie1976 @TheFamousArtBR @bindelj No, sorry, youve lost me there. Chippies have no business selling prawn crackers, its just wrong.
INFP|@WildWomyn @TheFamousArtBR @bindelj I was recently introduced to Tayto crisps. Be very careful about trying them, because theres no going back. Theyre the crisp equivalent of crack.
INFP|@trashalou @TheFamousArtBR @bindelj Where do we all stand on Twiglets? Im very seriously pro.
INFP|@EvolvesPhoenix @trashalou @bindelj Skips are also excellent. For me, its a dead heat.
INFP|@trashalou @bindelj Nobody is better than Quavers. Nobody.
INFP|@TheFamousArtBR @bindelj Nooooo, I cant be doing with Monster Munch. Frazzles, though ❤️🥓
INFP|@bindelj This makes me want Quavers.
INFP|@OakesMarianne I have a lovely life, Marianne, and far from being bitter I feel extremely fortunate (though I am indeed straight and 57 years old). As you asked to be corrected if youre wrong, which you are, here you go. 
INFP|Journalist Niloufar Hamedi has been arrested for reporting on #MahsaAmini s injuries. The regime is attempting to silence Iranian women by any means possible. It must be held accountable for its human rights violations. 
INFP|@Primark 
INFP|@soniasodha Not to mention corporations and celebrities whove been cheering Mermaids on without doing the slightest bit of due diligence.
INFP|.@MermaidsGender has been advising children about puberty blockers without parental consent. @MermaidsGender are trying to strip charitable status from LGB Alliance, who produced this film.
INFP|.@MermaidsGenders Chair of Trustees recently gave evidence under oath that Mermaids is not a medical organisation. Now an investigation reveals theyre advising kids on puberty blockers and providing binders to underage girls without parental consent. 
INFP|Big Tech companies, like YouTube and Twitter, have enabled this community. They know about the problem but have failed to act. They are voluntarily providing a platform and monetising content that encourages atrocities against women and girls. 
INFP|We’ve lost a genius.
INFP|The Iranian regime is killing young women who protest against its misogyny. #HananehKian #MahsaAmini
INFP|@BluskyeAllison You’re not alone, sis xxxxx 
INFP|Laws that allow males into women’s prisons are anti-progressive and anti-women… If you self-identify as a progressive or a liberal, this is an issue you should care about deeply, because women—right now—are being hurt. — Elizabeth Hummel 
INFP|@EuanYours @oolon @CllrKarenPower @baseroamer The accomplished barrister is probably quivering in her boots now shes seen your in-depth legal analysis.
INFP|@CllrKarenPower @baseroamer You must have plenty of evidence of Allison Baileys promotion of anti-trans views to keep making this accusation in public. The library was also following my account. Am I included in your blanket statement?
INFP|@BrayBri70 @DublinWoman @QueenMeabh @BluskyeAllison @CllrKarenPower @Fingalcoco As one of my very best and oldest friends is an Irish woman (Azkaban is dedicated to her) I know Ireland produces some of the best women in the world. As shed put it, eejits come in every nationality!
INFP|@OakTreeLaneN @BluskyeAllison @CllrKarenPower @Fingalcoco @RobertBohan Yep, and also with the wrong women. Allison’s got an army behind her these days, a fact these Twitter-like-hungry defamers ignore at their peril.
INFP|@BluskyeAllison @CllrKarenPower @Fingalcoco @RobertBohan Given recent court rulings, it’s troubling and bewildering to see people in positions of power throwing slurs at you. Always in your corner, Allison xxx
INFP|Then the rest of the world needs to keep saying her name. #MahsaAmini died aged 22 in police custody because she violated hijab regulations. Solidarity with all Iranians currently protesting.
INFP|@ClaireShrugged I thought we were friends.
INFP|The bravery of these women and the filthy brutality of the supposed guardians of morality. #MahsaAmini
INFP|@ChiefBrody19 Right back atcha, Chief 😘
INFP|After a weekend of intimidation and abuse of female protesters in the UK resulting in three arrests, a gay rights icon is beaten to the ground by a mob of gender ideologues in the US. Violence is not a bug, but a feature of this authoritarian movement. 🧵
INFP|@myrealname Woman unafraid and unashamed of saying that they love only women are the greatest affront to patriarchy theres ever been, which is why this straight woman says more power to you ❤️⚢
INFP|@DianeDidi15 @DreyfusJames Been working all day on the next one!
INFP|@Aromatica365 @AmandaPCraig These tactics would utterly discredit any other movement targeting any other group. Mens rights activism using male violence against women, enabled and excused by cowards and useful idiots.
INFP|@DreyfusJames Shit got real.
INFP|What true bravery looks like. #MahsaAmini
INFP|@IreCard1 @SinisterBulb Thank you, that means the world to me x
INFP|I see the Be Kind brigade are once more hiding behind their black masks, throwing smoke bombs, screaming scum at women speaking up for their sex-based rights and howling abuse at lesbians for not doing dick. #LetWomenSpeak #LesbianStrength2022 
INFP|@Kestrel7141 @UnionMac1 @iesamina @Apollo1776 @gaelicana @preselectlee Only 2% of sexual offenders are female. 88% of sexual assault victims are female. Trans women retain male strength advantage and male patterns of violence and sexual offending. We know TW arent all predators. However, the evidence shows that some are. 
INFP|@OceansWhisper94 
INFP|@iesamina @Apollo1776 @gaelicana @preselectlee Safeguarding exists not because all members of a group are a threat to another group, but because sufficient are to justify protected spaces for the more vulnerable group. Trans women retain the same pattern of sex offending/violence as males. 
INFP|@iesamina @Apollo1776 @gaelicana @preselectlee You havent read the article, have you? The trans woman attempted to rape a 10-year-old girl in a public bathroom. The trans woman in question had already filmed a 12-year-old over the top of a bathroom cubicle.
INFP|@iesamina @Apollo1776 @gaelicana @preselectlee There are many examples of it being a problem. Heres one.

INFP|@gdewilson Im so sorry about your dad. I think losing the queen and feeling that an era has ended brings a lot of our past bereavements into our minds. Sending love x
INFP|Most British people have never known another monarch, so she’s been a thread winding through all our lives. She did her duty by the country right up until her dying hours, and became an enduring, positive symbol of Britain all over the world. She’s earned her rest. #TheQueen
INFP|Some may find the outpouring of British shock and grief at this moment quaint or odd, but millions felt affection and respect for the woman who uncomplainingly filled her constitutional role for seventy years. 1/2
INFP|Children round the world are starting a new school year, but the future for Ukraines children is uncertain. @lumos is raising urgent funds for educational materials, plus vital food , medicine for families. If you can, please support our emergency appeal.

INFP|@rtaskeeter @SophieXY44 @MyObscurial @guerreroramey @SpitfireAudio Ive always wanted to try that.
INFP|@SophieXY44 @MyObscurial @guerreroramey @SpitfireAudio Tbh, I only met one tea I didnt like and I dont want to name it, because the brand makes other teas I love. But it smelled like vomit and I was afraid to brew it, so threw it away. Pretty tin, though.
INFP|@Emmett91651818 @MyObscurial @guerreroramey @SpitfireAudio 😘
INFP|@MyObscurial @guerreroramey @SpitfireAudio completely calm! Sitting here drinking herbal tea, no less!
INFP|@guerreroramey @SpitfireAudio of course trans rights are human rights and of course trans lives matter.
INFP|@guerreroramey @SpitfireAudio and, as I’ve said, gender confirmation certificates may now be granted without any need for surgery or hormones – then you open the door to any and all men who wish to come inside. That is the simple truth.
INFP|@guerreroramey @SpitfireAudio So I want trans women to be safe. At the same time, I do not want to make natal girls and women less safe. When you throw open the doors of bathrooms and changing rooms to any man who believes or feels he’s a woman –
INFP|@guerreroramey @SpitfireAudio Like every other domestic abuse and sexual assault survivor I know, I feel nothing but empathy and solidarity with trans women who’ve been abused by men.
INFP|@guerreroramey @SpitfireAudio Here are some other things Ive written (from my essay on gender identity ideology and womens rights I believe the majority of trans-identified people not only pose zero threat to others, but are vulnerable…
INFP|@guerreroramey @SpitfireAudio Because I see them as sticking up for the rights of women and girls. I see them as defending the language by which women can describe their sex-specific needs and rights.
INFP|@guerreroramey @SpitfireAudio it isn’t hate to speak the truth, and People who menstruate, Im sure there used to be a word for them etc. You consider those to demonstrate hatred of trans people/hate speech?
INFP|@guerreroramey @SpitfireAudio Ok, so were going with If sex isn’t real, there’s no same-sex attraction. If sex isn’t real, the lived reality of women globally is erased. I know and love trans people, but erasing the concept of sex removes the ability of many to meaningfully discuss their lives
INFP|@guerreroramey @SpitfireAudio OK, so show me my tweet of random hate speech. Ill take a single example.
INFP|@guerreroramey @SpitfireAudio Show me the that demonstrate hatred towards the trans community. Should be easy, sounds like there are loads.
INFP|@guerreroramey @SpitfireAudio No, entire community, sorry. I like to quote people correctly.
INFP|@guerreroramey @SpitfireAudio Which of my past show hatred towards a whole community?
INFP|@guerreroramey @SpitfireAudio Receipts, please.

As youll see in the novel, Juliet uses a two handed-grip when wielding her sword, whereas Helena can finish off a victim while drinking tea with the other hand, setting the cup down only to commence plucking.
INFP|@Remussed @bindelj Really? Why? Im quite superstitious about numbers, so need to know if theres another one to worry about.

INFP|@Muray77489387 @KEBrightbill Thanks for finding that. Useful.
INFP|@KEBrightbill Just so you know, I maintain an alternative account only to post pics of my knitting. Currently working on a series of 1980s pop stars in 4-ply wool. Very reasonable prices. This is a joke. Please do not buy knitted 1980s pop stars because you think I made them.
INFP|Id just like to note that anyone can make a mistake on here. Ive done it myself (eg, fallen for parodies) but Ive always acknowledged as much, whereas @KEBrightbill has used a fake tweet to prop up her theory that I have an alternative account on which I am virulently evil. 
INFP|@estellecostanza Could I get that on an inspirational poster for Christmas, John? Ideally in pastel colours with a panda on it x
INFP|.@KEBrightbill shared a debunked fake tweet, insisting it was genuine because someone she knew in real life screenshotted it when I tweeted it. Either that person lied to her, or shes lying. My original request stands!
INFP|Interesting reaction. 
INFP|@BeautifulisFree @KEBrightbill That makes me so happy x
INFP|@CenderGrit @KEBrightbill Thats incredible! Please tell him I love it!
INFP|@QuarterKnut 💖 Thank you. Sometimes this stuff grinds me down, but messages like yours mean so much to me.

INFP|My lawyers would also very much like to know the identity of your real life friend who screenshotted it herself. As this Tweet never came from my account, she cant have captured it in the form it appears here. 2/2
INFP|.@KEBrightbill This fake tweet was created when I deleted an entirely different Tweet with a typo in it, then reposted. The creator claimed this what what I deleted. I am asking you to delete this defamatory claim and acknowledge the truth. 1/2

INTJ|@ggreenwald @FT This is probably accurate.

INTJ|@Jason This is not to say that reporters in most western countries are simply coin-operated – they will defend their independence to the death, as acknowledging it at all would diminish their credibility. But it is also false/foolish to suggest that there is no influence.
INTJ|They claim to have a wall between news advertising, but reporters know full well who butters their bread. For example, there were nonstop bogus articles about electric cars on fire, even though they’re 500% to 1000% less likely to burn than combustion engine cars. As soon as the big car companies started advertising electric vehicles, those articles mysteriously disappeared …

INTJ|@alexavoigt I prefer technical interviews, but those have a smaller audience
INTJ|@EndWokeness Extremely misanthropic
INTJ|@WhatsupFranks @chhardman @PeterHotez @joerogan That would be interesting indeed
INTJ|@chhardman @PeterHotez @joerogan But it was a mistake to push for so many Covid-19 booster shots (even the initial vaccine shot was overkill on quantity). There‘s obviously risk of the immune system going out of control when it sees what what you’ve trained it to believe is a serious disease over , over again.
INTJ|Accurate summary. Look, I’m prepared to argue in favor of vaccines if you’d like. Do I think vaccines should be examined closely mortality risk isn’t substantially reduced in America? Yes. However, you should definitely take vaccines if traveling to places where that disease is prevalent! Do I think you should take most vaccines even if you never leave America? Also yes. The benefit may be small, but the risk is much smaller.
INTJ|@ashleevance 🎯
INTJ|@mcjamez I bought it anyway. Didn’t actually expect it to work like the video. But this is news that there is a drone – albeit expensive – that actually works!
INTJ|@farzyness Any scientist who refuses to be questioned is anything but
INTJ|@farzyness To be frank, we’re lucky to have modern medicine. I’d be dead from malaria if not for chloroquine , doxycycline. But, we should still question medicine, rather than considering it sacred. The entire foundation of science is to question it, thereby coming closer to the truth.
INTJ|@growingdaniel Still the most effective breath mint afaik
INTJ|@TheRabbitHole84 @joerogan There is an argument that the negatives of SSRIs outweigh the positives
INTJ|@GilliRoth @PeterHotez Exactly. Two of my kids are on the spectrum and they got it from me, not vaccines. It was obvious from when they were babies, but thankfully improved to some degree over time.
INTJ|First of all, I am generally pro vaccine. I have been vaccinated against pretty much everything, as have my kids. Second, I think there is tremendous promise in synthetic mRNA. It is like medicine going from analog to digital. That said, the world obviously went crazy with excess vaccination against Covid-19. I have that in quotes, because the RNA sequences changed so much that I called it the virus of Theseus. So many people I know had serious side effects from the vaccines, including myself. Failure to acknowledge that is a lie. As for the deaths you claim are due to Covid-19, why is the nation of Sweden still alive!? 🤔 Just go on Rogan and do the debate.
INTJ|In all seriousness, I agree that we should make elaborate tax-avoidance schemes illegal, but acting upon that would upset a lot of donors, so we will see words, but no action. Those who will actually be forced to carry the burden of excess government spending are lower to middle income wage earners, as they cannot escape payroll tax.

INTJ|@MattWalshBlog That said, it simply counts if you saw the post on the X/Twitter app or via web browser, not how long you watched
INTJ|@MattWalshBlog Correct

INTJ|This was a mistake by many people at Twitter. It is definitely allowed. Whether or not you agree with using someone’s preferred pronouns, not doing so is at most rude and certainly breaks no laws. I should note that I do personally use someone’s preferred pronouns, just as I use someone’s preferred name, simply from the standpoint of good manners. However, for the same reason, I object to rude behavior, ostracism or threats of violence if the wrong pronoun or name is used.

INTJ|Its all about the sound systems 
INTJ|The global system can be viewed — with some charity — as pragmatic/cynical means to serve idealistic ends. But what is now left of the idealism? That, not special interests, which have always been with us, is what endangers the system now 5/
INTJ|But now we see economies highly integrated with other economies, from Hungary to China, experiencing authoritarian backsliding, we see a globalized Russia engaged in an attempted war of conquest. 4/
INTJ|Closely associated was the idea that economic integration was a force for political reform 3/ 
INTJ|The world trading system, while its mechanics involved a lot of horse-trading among special interests, was built on the belief that trade was good for peace 2/ 
INTJ|Good article, but Im not sure it fully conveys what I consider the existential crisis of globalization — our loss of faith in its non-economic benefits 1/ 
INTJ|Apropos of nothing, but although I assume that the logo for Newark Airport is supposed to be the torch from the Statue of Liberty, I kept thinking, Why are they showing me an ice cream cone? 
INTJ|Getting hard to deny significant disinflation happening, despite unemployment close to historic low 
INTJ|Going to be traveling the next few weeks (and off from column, btw). Hoping the smoke is gone by the time Im back. 3/
INTJ|One of the surprising joys of living in New York is that I, at least, find it far easier to be active outside in Americas densest metropolis than in the suburbs. Even without the run in the park, you walk everywhere. Not at all hard to rack up 15,000 steps 2/
INTJ|So, I was going to do my usual morning run (Im 70 and fighting it), but checked AirNow and no. Its not terrible, but getting close to orange zone. 1/
INTJ|And if other countries emulate/retaliate with their own green industrial policies — well, that will actually be a good thing. It would be more efficient if we did this without any protectionism, but if this is what it takes, so be it 3/
INTJ|Related to what I wrote last month, but my emphasis was on what it took to get the thing passed, Appelbaum on creating facts that will make the policy durable 2/ 
INTJ|Excellent piece by Appelbaum about the rationale for nationalist aspects of Biden climate policy.. 1/ 
INTJ|A terrific resource for researchers — but may I also say for journalists? In a way it does for wealth what FRED has done for macroeconomic data — no excuse now for not having the basic facts at your fingertips 3/
INTJ|Until now, this information has been tricky to find, especially cross-country comparisons. Since estimating wealth distribution is tricky and sometimes controversial, it also lets you compare estimates from different sources, which is neat 2/
INTJ|My colleagues at the Stone Center have put together a remarkable new resource a website that provides easily accessible information on wealth inequality, which isnt the same thing as income inequality 1/ 
INTJ|This great 2017 Politico article on dictator chic laid it out very well. Its all about dominance and intimidation 2/

INTJ|Having a bit of fiscal fun with AI. What if it really is a massive game-changer? Goldman says 1.5 points added to productivity over the next decade. If you believe that, should change your views about everything — including fiscal outlook 1/
INTJ|At this point, however, 2% persists as the target mainly because its a badge of credibility. How much are we willing to pay for that ? 2/
INTJ|Actually a bit more than that. People thought, wrongly, that 2% was high enough that the zero lower bound wouldnt bind, while it was low enough that stable price types could convince themselves that with hedonic adjustments 2 was really 0 1/
INTJ|Put it this way the usual suspects claimed that a green energy transition would require huge economic sacrifice. Seeing this much investment in response to subsidies that are still only a fraction of 1% of GDP suggests otherwise 4/
INTJ|Third, when people say that growth of a sector isnt necessarily good, indeed, I say that right in the newsletter, with a comparison to Bitcoin mining. But theres a public purpose behind Biden industrial policy, so big is probably good 3/
INTJ|Second, when people say of course its happening, its being subsidized — well, yes, but the size of the boom has surprised everyone, including industrial policy proponents. So theres real news here 2/
INTJ|I guess I shouldnt be surprised that theres pushback against the observation of a Biden manufacturing boom. So first of all, no, it isnt just inflation. Deflate by whatever you like, and its still parabolic 1/

INTJ|Remember circa 2010 when some Wall Street types said inflation must be soaring, because home prices were rising in the Hamptons? 3/
INTJ|If the numbers are sometimes confusing, thats because were living in weird times, which disrupt data as well as supply chains. Above all, rich guys saying that the numbers must be fake because it doesnt match what theyre seeing have a long, bad history 2/
INTJ|One thing I should probably say, since Ive been joking about the weirdly contradictory signals that weve been getting from labor data, is that I have nothing but admiration and praise for the BLS, which is utterly professional. 1/
INTJ|And maybe the Feds job is done? 8/ 
INTJ|So we have a declining rate of cost increases and declining expectations of future inflation. An average would still show embedded inflation slightly above 3 percent — but its clearly down over the past year. Score one for immaculate disinflation hopes 7/
INTJ|The Atlanta Fed also asks businesses how much their costs have risen over the past year. This number was much lower than pre-revision ULC, but now theyre about the same 6/
INTJ|And we do have data on business expectations of future cost increases — more relevant and much more stable than consumer expectations, albeit only for Atlanta area. But still 5/ 
INTJ|inflation that would persist even if theres no major imbalance between aggregate supply and demand. In a world of staggered price and wage setting, this embedded inflation would reflect a combination of past cost increases and expected future increases 4/
INTJ|Ive complained in the past that we talk a lot about underlying inflation without any clear model of what that means. But we do have a pretty clear model — Phelps/Taylor/Calvo — of embedded inflation, defined as 3/
INTJ|Some economists have been pointing to rapidly rising ULC as a reason for pessimism about inflation. But suddenly ULC is telling a much less dire story. In fact, its suggesting major disinflation 2/ 
INTJ|Ive been saying for a while that the BLS is messing with our heads — or, actually, that in a time of big structural shifts different indicators give contrary indications, plus we get big revisions. So heres what the latest revisions have done to unit labor costs 1/ 
INTJ|So while I wish we had a broader survey, maybe asking firms about their costs has its virtues, and I still think my approach to measuring embedded inflation has merit. Heres where it stands now 4/ 
INTJ|But the BLS numbers have been revised, and now show unit labor costs over the year ending the first quarter rising 3.8 percent, right in line with the Atlanta Fed survey 3/ 
INTJ|I received some grief from Jason Furman among others, because the Atlanta Fed survey showed business costs rising 3.6 percent over the previous year, but BLS unit labor costs were up more than 6 percent 2/
INTJ|A while back I posted a thread about measuring underlying inflation, which tried to use a clear conceptual framework and Atlanta Fed data 1/ 
INTJ|the only interpretation thats completely indefensible is saying that were in a recession 3/
INTJ|If you want to make the case that the economy is running too hot, and we need more rate hikes, you can find data to support that. If you want to argue that a soft landing is in progress, there are numbers for that too 2/
INTJ|Given this weeks labor market data, theres only one possible conclusion the BLS is messing with our heads. (OK, not really, but still). Vacancies are up, but quits are back to prepandemic. Job growth is humungous, but unemployment is up and wage growth slowing 1/
INTJ|So opposition to collective action on pandemic protection or climate change carries over into anti-vax crusades and attempts to strangle renewable energy. It doesnt make logical sense, but the politics of rage dont have to.2/
INTJ|Ive coined a term the anti-woke mind virus, which infects right-wing views even on issues that have nothing to do with social justice. Getting yourself vaccinated is simple self-interest, as is investing in renewable energy. But theyre woke-adjacent 1/

INTJ|One point I havent seen emphasized about the budget deal is that as far as I can tell, its not going to involve a major hit to the safety net for children. The new SNAP work requirements are cruel, but they apply to childless adults in their 50s 1/
INTJ|Finance industry types telling me that theres a lot of buzz about M2, which I thought had been consigned to the dustbin. But anyway, remember the nasty recession of 1995, or the runaway inflation of 2003? Neither do I 
INTJ|This is, by the way, why polls saying that the public wants to cut spending are meaningless, talk about actual spending cuts that might make a noticeable difference to the budget, and people hate them 3/
INTJ|Everything else includes a lot of essential stuff few people want to cut. No, we cant balance the budget by eliminating foreign aid (a trivial sum) or green spending, or for some people on the left, by slashing military spending 2/
INTJ|I still get lots of mail to the effect that we just need to get rid of wasteful spending. So your regular reminder that the federal govt is an insurance company with an army 1/ 
INTJ|Or to put it differently, making it easier for the rich to evade taxes they legally owe, harder for the poor to get benefits to which they’re legally entitled
INTJ|It will be an ugly outcome even if it comes off, and it still might not. But even though Im relatively favorable to break-glass strategies, Ill be happy if this gets put behind us so we can focus on other outrages 7/
INTJ|In short, I think everything mattered nihilism of many Rs, R underperformance in the midterms, and the existence of possible if risky D escape routes 6/
INTJ|So whats left is modified, limited extortion that fails to satisfy a good part of the R caucus but is sufficiently not-too-evil that it can get D votes. Of course, this could cost McCarthy his job 5/
INTJ|Biden might be inclined, despite howls from progressives (myself included) to capitulate to a plan that was still extreme but less so. But McCarthys own right wing would probably vote no, bc theyre into performance not substance, so hed need D votes that he couldnt get 4/
INTJ|McCarthy could probably get his whole party on board for an extreme, Freedom Caucus type plan. But Ds would reject this out of hand, this would lead to minting the coin, perpetual bonds, or something no matter how reluctant some in the admin are 3/
INTJ|Basically narrow R majority, nihilism of a good chunk of R caucus, and the existence of potential workarounds, even if Biden and co hate the idea of using them 2/
INTJ|So, as of this AM, from what I read, its Schroedingers debt deal. R insistence on destructive work requirements could still kill this thing. But the numbers look much less awful than many Ds feared. Why? I think 3 things 1/

INTJ|To be honest, I thought Ron DeSantiss attacks on central bank digital currencies, while revealing, wouldnt remain a major message — not exactly a guys-in-diners issue 1/ 
INTJ|Almost afraid to ask this. But if all the hostage-taking accomplished so little, can McCarthy sell this to his caucus?
INTJ|Even if there is a debt deal, it may fall through — and important to keep the options open, now and for the future 
INTJ|When will we agree on the answers to these questions? Never. And dont count the game of chicken over until it has hatched. 4/
INTJ|Were proposals for an end run around the debt limit helpful, even if not invoked, by making Rs aware that they couldnt demand anything that would truly derail the D agenda? 3/
INTJ|Baseline should the deal be compared with what Rs should have gotten (nothing) or with what they hoped to achieve (evisceration of the safety net)? 2/
INTJ|Reporting suggesting a possible debt deal that is qualitatively awful — more tax evasion! Less aid to children! — but quantitatively less bad than feared. If it comes together, by no means certain, the spin wars will be epic 1/
INTJ|Hey, look at the balance of payments As far as I can tell, Americas biggest export in 2022 — by a large margin — was errors and omissions.
INTJ|Im terrified about the possible implications of actual default. But the rating agencies are just irrelevant 2/
INTJ|Since theres a lot of buzz about possible rating agencies downgrading US debt, a reminder about what happened in 2011. See the big impact? Neither do I. 1/ 
INTJ|Obviously we dont know if we can pull it off. But this paper is a far more optimistic take than a lot of what we were hearing, say, a year ago 5/
INTJ|Given the recent decline in vacancies without rising unemployment (upper left in this figure), immaculate disinflation is still a real possibility 4/ 
INTJ|Its a fairly minor factor! That said, they conclude (and I agree) that the economy is indeed overheated, and needs to cool down. The important question is how much unemployment will rise in the process 3/
INTJ|Key picture on sources of inflation, V/U (the vacancy/unemployment ratio) is the effect of an overheated economy 2/ 
INTJ|Reading Bernanke-Blanchard on inflation, which actually has a fairly startling bottom line the people who were right about inflation were mostly right for the wrong reasons 1/ 
INTJ|Right now the buzz is that the admin is looking for accounting tricks that will give us a few more weeks before outright default. I hope that if this works theyll use the time to find alternatives to surrender, as opposed to lashing out at unorthodox proposals 3/
INTJ|Opposition to end-runs around the debt ceiling is basically political — not that theyre bad economics, not even that theyre clearly unconstitutional, but that they would fail politically. But the people saying this have been wrong about the politics every step of the way 2/
INTJ|My prediction from last week, coming true 1/ 
INTJ|I grew up in the bums on welfare era, my sense is that many Republicans still think welfare is for lazy Black men. But the reality of Black employment has been transformed 
INTJ|Good for Olivier. Acknowledging bad calls makes you more credible, not less
INTJ|Yep. My employer has many strengths — but the data graphics really stand out
INTJ|Very much this. Will write more later today. But what strikes me is that the anti-14th crowd never suggests what Biden should do other than concede complete control to a party that controls one house of Congress 
INTJ|Key passage that gives you a sense of the nastiness 3/ 
INTJ|Read Greg Mankiws 1991 essay The reincarnation of Keynesian economics 2/ 
INTJ|Lots of virulent responses to my remarks about Robert Lucas, understandably so. But if you imagine that the attack on Keynesian macroeconomics wasnt at the core of the Lucas et al project you clearly werent there 1/ 
INTJ|Not my cat, but basically how this was written 
INTJ|So, the Fed survey of economic well-being is out. Households feeling worse than last year, probably because of expiration of pandemic aid. But an even bigger gap between self-assessment and perception that other people are doing badly 
INTJ|The risk from a debt default is not that some other currency will take over the key role now played by dollar securities. It is that no currency will be available to play that role — that financial markets will be disrupted by the lack of any safe, liquid asset 2/
INTJ|Kind of amazing how often one sees assertions that the global role of the dollar lets America borrow at low interest rates. Do you even FRED, bros? 1/ 
INTJ|Aha. One additional observation if you really believed in the Lucas model, disinflation right now should be no problem at all. All the Fed has to do is credibly commit to 2 percent inflation, and presto, we have 2% inflation, without a recession 11/
INTJ|This had dire consequences for the profession. But thats a topic for another day 10/
INTJ|By the mid-80s, then, the Lucas model of the business cycle had intellectually imploded. Unfortunately, by then many macroeconomists had invested all their intellectual capital in this failed project, and refused to give up 9/
INTJ|It also became clear that if you assume that people have access to all public information — which Lucas-type models do — people can tell that theyre facing contractionary monetary policy by looking at interest rates 8/ 
INTJ|Do we really think people went through this whole period believing that they were facing negative demand shocks specific to their own businesses, not a generally depressed economy? 7/
INTJ|But this approach quickly ran aground in the face of both evidence and theory. Let me poach one of the (lovely) graphics from my soft-landing piece. The era of elevated unemployment in the 80s lasted eight years 6/ 
INTJ|So the Lucas supply curve said, basically, that the Fed can induce a recession for a while because people dont know that theyre in a recession — they think theyre facing idiosyncratic demand shocks 5/ 
INTJ|Lucas had an ingenious answer in the short run, people cant tell the difference between changes in the overall price level, which they shouldnt respond to, and changes in the relative price of their product, which should elicit changes in supply 4/
INTJ|After all, with flexible prices and rational actors, money should be neutral — double the money supply, and all prices will double, with no effect on the real economy, which only depends on relative prices 3/
INTJ|Lucas sought to make business cycle theory a branch of conventional microeconomics, with perfectly rational individuals and all markets in equilibrium. But in such a world, how can decisions by central banks have large real consequences? 2/
INTJ|OK, something that isnt about the d c. Obituaries have acknowledged his brilliance and huge influence, all of which is true. But I think its important to realize that his project to reform macroeconomics was a failure 1/ 
INTJ|Unilateral actions might fail — or be blocked by a partisan Supreme Court. But what are people pointing out these risks saying that Biden should do? Capitulate completely? (Even that might not be enough). If thats the plan, say it clearly 2/
INTJ|So much writing on the debt ceiling right now seems utterly behind the curve. The question now is what does Biden do if Rs refuse any deal that doesnt effectively give them complete control of US policy? Or maybe even actively seek financial crisis? 1/
INTJ|What I wrote a few days ago. Seriously, what the heck did Biden and Co. think would happen? 
INTJ|Nobody could have predicted …
INTJ|So at this point it seems as if the Underpants Gnomes devised the administrations debt ceiling policy 1. Ridicule all possible Plan Bs 2. ????? 3. Clean increase in the ceiling ??? seems to have been centrists and business pressuring Rs to behave well. What could go wrong?
INTJ|Jack says I should stop obsessing about the debt ceiling 
INTJ|The discourse from responsible people around the debt ceiling is starting to have a definite Stockholm Syndrome feel — as if the those of us who have spent years urging officials to find a way to stand up to extortion, not the extortionists, are the problem 3/
INTJ|But the administration will have to do something if there is no deal, or GOP extortion is too extreme to accept. You cant talk about the downsides to unorthodox policy except relative to the alternatives 2/
INTJ|Everyone paying attention is aware that there are big problems with all of the possible workarounds for the debt limit — not with the economics, which are perfectly fine, or even with the legal basis, but with the possibility that partisan judges will kill them 1/
INTJ|No, governments dont have to pay off their debt. And for the past 2 centuries they often havent 
INTJ|Of course, a debt default would be one way to guarantee a hard landing no matter what 6/
INTJ|My biggest worry, however, is that even if a soft landing is possible, very hard for the Fed to stick it given uncertainties about the data and the lagged effects of policy. Being data-dependent doesnt help as much as you might think 5/
INTJ|Im on the cooling without much pain side of this debate, but without high confidence — anyone highly confident right now may well be suffering from Dunning-Kruger, macroeconomics version 4/
INTJ|Also a debate about what cooling will involve. Need it involve a large rise in unemployment, or can we normalize things without large job losses? Reasonable people differ! 3/
INTJ|There is, I think, a fairly wide consensus that the US economy is running too hot, although a lot of debate about how much cooling is needed just a return to normal temperatures, or an extended period of slack? 2/
INTJ|So my project on prospects for a soft landing is up. I tried to highlight the common ground in this discussion (which is often testy), and also distinguish between two kinds of problems 1/ 
INTJ|More in the Times thread — and of course in the article itself 5/ 
INTJ|But we dont know how hard it will be to squeeze out the rest of the excess inflation — and Im very worried about the Feds ability to stick a soft landing even if its possible in principle 4/
INTJ|This time weve come down substantially without any rise in unemployment at all — so far 3/ 
INTJ|So far, disinflation has been much easier than it was in the 1980s, back then we went through many years of high unemployment 2/ 
INTJ|So, I have a long form discussion of prospects for a soft landing. I tried to explain rather than preach this is a tough topic on which smart, well-informed people have very different views 1/ 
INTJ|My inclination is to be optimistic. But is that motivated reasoning? The truth is that we wont know who was right in this debate for quite a few months 5/
INTJ|These are both serious analysts working with more or less the same data. A lot of the problem, I think, is that this stuff is largely model-free. No clear definition — certainly no agreed-upon — definition of underlying inflation 4/
INTJ|And Matt Klein saying that its clearly moving sideways 3/ 
INTJ|Heres Joey Politano saying that its clearly cooling 2/ 
INTJ|On the inflation front, we know that conventional measures have been distorted by the pandemic and aftermath. So I rely a lot on people who carefully parse the data in an attempt to figure out whats happening to underlying inflation. But 1/
INTJ|Tobin 1962!
INTJ|Tax avoidance is a big deal 
INTJ|So employment is at record levels, so is job satisfaction, and concerns about inflation have greatly receded. And people believe that the economy is in terrible shape 
INTJ|Dear followers I am not paying for a check mark. It just magically reappeared.
INTJ|Supercar inflation 
INTJ|Does raise the question, given terrific state of the labor market, why people are still so down on the economy. Last year SHED data said people were doing well financially, but thought the economy was bad anyway. Waiting for next report 3/
INTJ|I took 4-week moving averages of Google inflation searches. Still somewhat elevated, but suggests that the psychological and perhaps political salience has come down a lot 2/ 
INTJ|Neat idea. Imperfect measure, but still an interesting indicator 1/
INTJ|But hard to say one point three three nine trillion dollars in a Dr. Evil voice.
INTJ|The good news is that so far it seems as if weve been getting significant labor market cooling without a rise in unemployment. Soft landing hopes are still very much alive 
INTJ|Mike Konczal has it annualized, also 3-month (which is volatile). I wouldnt call it sideways — data are consistent with gradual disinflation — but this still looks like a somewhat overheated economy 
INTJ|Supercore (one definition) still elevated but still trending down 
INTJ|Not important, but why were bases named after especially incompetent Confederate generals like Braxton Bragg, routed at Chattanooga, and Hood, who got his men slaughtered at Franklin?
INTJ|Anyone calling the GOP plan reasonable should be ignored from now on 
INTJ|Again, none of this looks great. But consider the alternative, which is surrendering to extortion by extremists 6/
INTJ|Premium bonds or even consols might be an alternative. Would the courts really rule them invalid when, in terms of par value, they dont even breach the debt limit? 5/
INTJ|Alternatively, invoke 14th Amendment but also mint the coin as a temporary expedient. As I explained here, the coin would actually be back door borrowing — Treasury isnt selling bonds, the Fed is. Avert crisis while waiting for a ruling 4/ 
INTJ|So, if the administration goes 14th Amendment, concerns that it might have trouble selling new debt because of risk that the courts will declare the debt invalid. But isnt this a question of price? Basically bridge financing with junk bonds? 3/
INTJ|Another crucial starting point is that payments on existing debt must be maintained, so that it continues to be usable as collateral in the financial system 2/
INTJ|A few thoughts on managing the debt crisis. I am neither a legal nor a market expert, although I dont think anyone knows how this will go. But surely the starting point has to be just how disastrous it will be if extortion succeeds. 1/
INTJ|Indeed. International is my home field, so I’m used to the concept of sterilized intervention. Applies exactly in this case.
INTJ|LOTS of misinformation out there from people who should know better but havent thought it through. There are no, zero, macroeconomic problems with using gimmicks to circumvent the debt ceiling 3/
INTJ|The Fed can and would sterilize any impact on the monetary base by selling federal securities — so that in economic terms the coin would simply be a backdoor route to perfectly normal borrowing. Premium bonds a bit more complicated, but same bottom line 2/
INTJ|Finally onsite after some glitches. Its really important to understand that some of the economic objections to debt ceiling workarounds — notably claims that minting the coin would be inflationary monetary financing of the debt — are all wrong 1/ 
INTJ|No doubt some of the responses, if any, will be But debt is 100% of GDP and debt service is rising! But I do not think those numbers mean what you think they mean 10/
INTJ|So no debt spiral. Economists will know that this is because despite CBOs assumption that rates will stay high, were still in an rlt,g world. This is just a different way of making the point. 9/
INTJ|To show this, I asked what would happen to debt using CBOs projected interest rates, but without primary deficits, so that debt accumulation would come purely from borrowing to pay interest — a pure debt spiral. Again, the picture 8/ 
INTJ|And even so CBO isnt projecting a debt spiral the rising debt ratio is the result of projected primary (non-interest) deficits, not interest accumulation. 7/
INTJ|Its true that CBO projects both a rise in debt/GDP and a rise in debt service/GDP over the next decade. But much of the latter rise doesnt reflect higher debt, it reflects the assumption that interest rates will stay high 6/ 
INTJ|Beyond that, many people seem to think that were heading for a debt spiral more debt means more interest payments, which requires more borrowing, which means even more debt, and off we go. Sounds intuitive but 5/
INTJ|And its not at all unprecedented, Contemporary Japan is of course far higher. But also note that Britain achieved the Industrial Revolution with debt far above current US levels 4/ 
INTJ|First is that 100% is an especially significant number, and historically unprecedented. But its a ratio of a stock to a flow, it depends on the convention of measuring GDP on an annual basis. If we used quarterly it would be 400%! 3/
INTJ|What got me started was the mail I get every time I write about debt and the debt ceiling — stuff along the lines you forgot to mention that debt is 100% of GDP and debt service is rising. Of course I didnt forget. But this sort of thing reflects two big misunderstandings 2/
INTJ|Thinking about debt, and some common misconceptions. I thought Id start with a picture that needs explaining, although its just a new way to make a point many economists — but not many other people — already know 1/ 
INTJ|The key point Seemingly odd solutions to the debt limit, like the coin and premium bonds, are in essence just ways of doing normal borrowing that exploit loopholes in the language. They arent inflationary or irresponsible in any way.
INTJ|For some reason latest newsletter isnt properly on site. But you can read it here 
INTJ|The visual world building is terrific — its not quite how I pictured the Silo, its better. And while we only get a glimpse so far of Rebecca Ferguson, who will be at the storys center, shes already one heck of a presence 2/
INTJ|In completely unrelated news, just watched episode 1 of Apple TVs adaptation of Silo, having read the books. I was worried their adaption of Foundation utterly betrayed the whole premise. But this is really good, so far 1/
INTJ|If so, cooling demand can bring inflation down without a large rise in unemployment. I think this is probably true — but worry about whether the Feds motor control is good enough to do this without precipitating an unnecessary recession 2/
INTJ|Wanna highlight this from Benigno and Eggertsson — and not just bc the title is an homage to an old paper of mine — making the case that a lot of the recent inflation surge reflected a strongly nonlinear Phillips curve 1/ 
INTJ|I think the general lesson is that given the wide disruptions of the pandemic economy, which still arent over, we should be wary of interpreting anything that happens as a long-term change 4/
INTJ|But heres what it looks like now 3/ 
INTJ|The key figure was this one 2/ 
INTJ|Hard to overstate how good the labor market news has been, and not just how many people are working. Last year there were some dolorous takes about job matching, suggesting that we could never get back to late 00s unemployment 1/ 
INTJ|Including this 3/ 
INTJ|Also, 1973 was the first summer I spent away from home. My mother gave me a cookbook 2/
INTJ|I know there are serious issues here, but do people remember what passed for coffee back then?
INTJ|Were just weeks from crunch time. No excuse for misinforming readers about such basic stuff 4/
INTJ|It would be like foreign exchange intervention, which in the U.S. has always been sterilized to make a clear distinction between FX and monetary policy 3/ 
INTJ|Its not a fact. Almost surely no impact on the monetary base at all, because the Fed would sterilize payments to Treasury by selling bonds, this would actually just be backdoor borrowing, not monetary finance 2/ 
INTJ|Depressing to see the WaPo report as fact — not even a some economists say — the claim that minting the coin would be inflationary 1/ 
INTJ|Again minting the coin is just borrowing through the back door. Its not financing the deficit through seigniorage, its not a way to avoid interest payments. Its just a bookkeeping trick to avoid extortion 7/
INTJ|And the Fed remits earnings on its assets back to the Treasury after deducting operating expenses. So the government would end up losing the equivalent of the interest it would have paid on the bonds the Fed sells 6/
INTJ|And one more no, the government wouldnt be getting a zero-interest loan. If the Fed sterilizes withdrawals from the Treasury account by selling bonds, it loses the interest on those bonds 5/
INTJ|What I think may be the source of confusion creating the account doesn’t need sterilization, withdrawals from the account do 4/
INTJ|The end result is that using the coin to pay bills isnt monetary policy, because the Fed doesnt let it change the relevant money supply. Its really just borrowing through the back door 3/
INTJ|If it stopped there, it would be as if Treasury was paying its bills by printing money. But Fed would almost surely remove the newly created monetary base by selling bonds. (Thats sterilization when we do foreign exchange intervention). 2/
INTJ|Gah. Maybe not as clear as intended. Fed accepts coin, Treasury then draws on its account to pay for stuff, either receiving actual cash or, mostly, making payments that show up in bank reserves. So monetary base — currency plus reserves — injected into system 1/
INTJ|What Ive been saying is that the IRA will crowd in business investment, but may crowd out residential investment by keeping interest rates elevated.
INTJ|Suitcases full of $100 bills ftw
INTJ|As for claims that Powell would refuse to accept the coin, or the Supremes would block premium bonds — well, nobody knows. But my guess is that nobody wants to be the guy who destroys the world economy. Even people happy to see it burn dont want their fingerprints on it 9/
INTJ|But as I said, people who really should know better constantly get this wrong, and imagine that the coin would be inflationary. And thats a reason to prefer a route that doesnt inspire confident misconceptions 8/
INTJ|Think of the Fed as a branch of the federal government, which from a fiscal point of view it is. Then this consolidated entity would in effect be covering deficits by selling bonds — i.e., normal deficit finance, just through the back door 7/
INTJ|I keep seeing people saying that this would be MMT, that wed just be printing money to cover the deficit. But it wouldnt be that at all. The Fed would surely sterilize any impact on the monetary base by selling off some of its huge portfolio of U.S. debt 6/
INTJ|The coin Treasury exploits a quirk that permits minting of platinum coins in any denomination to mint a coin with a face value of $1 trillion, deposits it at the Fed, then uses funds from that bank account to pay bills 5/
INTJ|Extreme example would be consols, which are just a perpetual coupon with no principal. In my experience, if you try to explain all this, peoples eyes glaze over — which is good! Hard to get outraged over something that baffles you 4/
INTJ|Since market interest rates are way below 10%, such a bond could be auctioned off for much more than $1000 — but Treasury could say that if the bond replaces an existing $1000 bond, it hasnt increased the debt even though its raising a lot of money 3/
INTJ|Premium bonds a bond has a principal or face value, which is what is paid when it matures, and a coupon that is paid every year until then. The idea is to issue bonds with, say, a $1000 principal and a $100 annual coupon. 2/
INTJ|About possible end runs around the debt ceiling. I have no inside information, but my guess is that premium bonds are a more likely route than the platinum coin. Why? Because nobody understands premium bonds, while people think — wrongly — that they understand the coin 1/
INTJ|Or my (not serious) theory that the BLS is just having fun at economists expense
INTJ|Can we point out that an arms race over subsidies to green energy is a GOOD thing? Taking action on climate is more important than the downsides of nationalism, even if they exist 
INTJ|I suspect that Biden et al would prefer the first, but in the end will do whatever it takes. Rs are trying a financial version of January 6, this cannot stand 3/
INTJ|The possible paths are - Discharge petition, forcing a floor vote that brings in a handful of sane Rs -14th amendment Just say we dont believe the debt ceiling is constitutional - platinum coin - premium bonds, which sell for much more than face value 2/
INTJ|So I now see four possible paths through the debt ceiling crisis. Reaching a deal with Kevin McCarthy isnt one of them 1/ 
INTJ|Low response rates are an issue — but JOLTS is just catching up with private surveys. And its a really hopeful sign that this has happened with no rise in unemployment. Really hard to argue now that we need 5% unemployment forever 2/
INTJ|So my theory about the economy is that the BLS is having fun messing with our heads. OK, not really. But first we get an ECI saying that the labor market isnt cooling, now JOLTS saying oh yes it is 1/ 
INTJ|Excellent. Few economists have changed my views about how the world economy works as much as Gabriels work.
INTJ|But the bigger crisis is the acronym shortage. Is the IRA the Inflation Reduction Act or the Irish Republican Army? Is CHIPS the Childrens Health Insurance Program or Creating Helpful Incentives for Production of Semiconductors?
INTJ|Im old enough (meaning very old) to remember when the main landmarks in Kendall Square were the F,T Diner, specialty hash and beans, and the Terminal Sub Shop (at the old bus terminal)
INTJ|I’m at MIT for the Dick Eckaus memorial, and saw something interesting in Kendall Square. I guess it wasn’t just Silicon Valley 
INTJ|Very curious to see what people who really know these numbers have to say 2/
INTJ|Well, I was hoping that the ECI would show clear evidence of wage deceleration. It didnt. The excluding incentive paid number is actually up, but its not seasonally adjusted, and tends to be low in 4th quarter and high in 1st. So not awful but not what I wanted to see. 1/
INTJ|Another utility post misery index, as sum of 6-month inflation and unemployment 
INTJ|Utility post 6-month rate of CPI inflation, annualized 
INTJ|Careful examination of the entrails of the GDP report reveals that a great kingdom will fall. Which kingdom? When? Does Tucker Carlson count? Unclear. More seriously, looking (as you should) at final demand shows no hint of recession.
INTJ|What do you mean we? If ever there was a time to talk about them 
INTJ|A probably doomed effort to introduce some clarity and preregister how Im going to read incoming data 
INTJ|I write about why (some) people are leaving New York not crime or taxes, but housing costs 
INTJ|But this is a lot like the potential overthrow of Vladimir Putin if it happens, his successor will probably be even worse 2/
INTJ|Darn. I was just at the drugstore, getting my Covid booster. If Id known I would have picked up some over the counter Schadenfreude medication 1/ 
INTJ|Damn. Was hoping to make a blue Czech joke, but life satisfaction in Czechia is roughly what youd expect given per capita income. America, on the other hand 
INTJ|So my blue check has reappeared. I had nothing to do with that, and am definitely not paying
INTJ|via @NYTOpinion 
INTJ|More. Gotta say the image creator in Bing is addictive. My prompt was just Disney prison 
INTJ|With DeSantis saying he might put a prison next to Disney World, I just used DALL-E for the first time 
INTJ|But my main point is that we need to clearly define what we mean by underlying inflation — it should be grounded in some kind of model. And much as I respect the data crunching, I dont think were seeing enough of that 12/
INTJ|Picture 11/ 
INTJ|Productivity has been really odd. My guess is that we saw a quirky divergence from trend, which inflates recent measures of unit labor cost, but others mileage may differ 10/
INTJ|And Jason Furman argues that the Atlanta Fed #s are too optimistic. Certainly willing to consider that possibility, although the unit labor cost #s reflect some odd productivity behavior. But I do think this is the right framework 9/ 
INTJ|Kind of remarkable that this seems to be happening with unemployment still very low and vacancies high. But anyway thats my logic. Not trying to make the case for a soft landing, and embedded inf still looks above Fed target. But looks better than many numbers you hear 8/
INTJ|How does disinflation happen in this story? A weaker labor market leads firm to try and undershoot the average, which slows wage growth (the past) and feeds through into falling expected growth (the future). So embedded inflation falls 7/
INTJ|Why not use either consumer expectations or market expectations? Because neither consumers nor bond traders set wages and prices, and the story involves perceived competitive conditions rather than the cost of living 6/
INTJ|And as I tweeted earlier, Atlanta Fed data give us this, with current embedded inflation a bit above 3% 5/ 
INTJ|Just to match the average, a wage-setter who revises wages once a year must raise wages 10% each time — half to make up for past inflation, half to get ahead of future inflation. So the embedded rate of inflation is the average of past and expected future wage cost rises 4/
INTJ|A picture, which I could swear Ive circulated before, but cant find, shows equilibrium, self-sustaining 10% wage inflation 3/ 
INTJ|Basic idea, going back to Phelps 1968, is embedded inflation via staggered wage setting. Imagine that each wage-setter aims to set a wage relative to rivals/suppliers depending on state of labor market, if conditions are neutral it just tries to match the average over time 2/
INTJ|Coming back to this, because I think some more explanation may be in order. And Ivan Wernings excellent piece, which I cite, is very much written for academics, so maybe I can supply some more intuition 1/
INTJ|Embrace your personal tempo 
INTJ|On a different topic, forgot to tweet this out 
INTJ|So, underlying inflation by this measure still high but down significantly from its peak, even though unemployment hasnt risen at all. Not so different from what many are saying, but in this case theres actually some theory behind it. 13/
INTJ|Where by embedded inflation I mean the amount by which firms would raise prices even in the absence of excess demand or supply. And again, heres what that average looks like 12/ 
INTJ|The survey asks businesses how much unit costs rose in the past year and how much they expect them to rise over the year ahead. A Werning-type analysis suggests that the average of these numbers should measure embedded inflation 11/
INTJ|Obv Ivan does a lot more than I did there. But heres the question can we actually implement this model-based concept? Actually, yes, using data from the Atlanta Feds Business Expectations Survey 10/ 
INTJ|Heres a 2008 blog post on embedded inflation that lays out a story about wage-setting that, I think, is exactly what Ivan is saying inflation can be self-sustaining through a combination of expectations and catchup, with the implied weights equal 9/ 
INTJ|When I was a young economist, I used to mock older guys whose response to any idea was Its trivial, its wrong, and I said it in 1963. Now Im one of those guys — except this isnt trivial and I dont think its wrong. I did, however, say something like this in 2008 8/
INTJ|So the coefficient on expected inflation per se isnt 1. In a Taylor model in which prices and wages are reset at fixed intervals, its actually 1/2. Again, still no tradeoff btw inflation and unemployment, but its not just a straight expectations story 7/
INTJ|Part of why firms keep raising prices is to get ahead of expected price increases by their competitors and suppliers, but part of it is catchup with increases in others prices since the last time you raised your own prices. 6/
INTJ|Its true that standard models of staggered price-setting, which underly much inflation analysis, say that there is no long-run inflation-unemployment tradeoff, but when firms raise prices in a sustained inflationary environment, expectations are only part of the story 5/
INTJ|Ivans point was that while we economists often write down a Phillips curve which shows expected inflation having a one-for-one effect on actual inflation, thats not actually what our models say 4/
INTJ|Whats lacking, I think I now believe, is a clear model of what were trying to measure. Enough facts — time for some theory! And I found myself rereading a 2022 paper by Ivan Werning 3/ 
INTJ|Background Ive become increasingly disillusioned with attempts to measure underlying inflation, which seem more and more like the efforts of haruspices to find auguries in the entrails of animal sacrifices. (This goes for my own efforts too). 2/
INTJ|Wonk alert! Its a beautiful day, soon Im going to take a run in the park, but first, some thoughts about inflation, where I may actually have something new to say. Bottom line here, Ill explain shortly what I mean and where it comes from 1/ 
INTJ|Robin called to correct me — the guy was ranting to the cashier and to her 3/
INTJ|So DeSantis is probably tied in with a broader push by monetary conspiracy theory types. This has actually been a right-wing thing for a while, even if the theories keep getting crazier 2/ 
INTJ|True story My wife was in line, waiting for coffee, and the guy in front was ranting to his companion about how central bank digital currencies are going to take away our freedom. 1/
INTJ|So many definitions of underlying inflation that you can almost always find a number that confirms your priors. But this report still looks like immaculate disinflation — inflation falling without any rise in unemployment 
INTJ|via @NYTOpinion 
INTJ|In passing I mentioned that the easy solution would be to allow individual accounts at the Fed, but that the banking lobby would never allow it. Dean Baker runs with that 2/ 
INTJ|Yesterday I wrote about the bizarre DeSantis conspiracy theory about digital currency, which is essentially a defense of illegal activity 1/ 
INTJ|Why, its almost as if weve had a Biden Boom
INTJ|There have been some false dawns on the inflation front, still waiting for CPI next week and ECI late this month. But this was a really good report for inflation optimists.
INTJ|She was also very cool in the face of three disruptive members of the audience (Im from San Francisco. Im used to this.) As best we can tell, they were LaRouchies — always an occupational hazard at GC events
INTJ|She was sharp and funny as always
INTJ|Americans die earlier than their counterparts in other rich countries. Why? Regional disparities point to politics 
INTJ|So Im back from vacation and back into the news flow, alas. While away, however, I indulged in some thinking not at all relevant to current events, specifically on technological change and trade. Heres a short semi-academic paper on the subject 
INTJ|Reposting this chart, with the dates right, for reference 
INTJ|Gah. This one was also 1990 to 2019 4/ 
INTJ|And theres a strong correlation with political lean. Comparing change in life expectancy 1990-2019 with Biden margin in 2020 3/ 
INTJ|Its important to realize that these regional differences are relatively new, and that a lot of dismal overall US performance reflects even more dismal performance by only part of the country. Heres an illustrative comparison 2/ 
INTJ|Lots of people suddenly writing about dismal US life expectancy. Glad to see focus on the geography, as in this good piece by Jeremy Ney 1/ 
INTJ|Ive been on that car. Well done.
INTJ|More about this in the days to come 8/
INTJ|And yes, theres a strong correlation with politics. Looking at changes from 1990-2019 (Covid initially hit NY hard, but that was an anomaly), heres what it looks like (leaving out DC, which is way up to the upper right) 7/ 
INTJ|This is a relatively recent development. In 1990 Ohio had slightly higher life expectancy than NY. By 2019 Nyers could expect to live gt,4 years longer 6/
INTJ|One thing he didnt point out, however, is that theres a strong regional aspect to the life expectancy story. Some states like NY and CA have more or less normal advanced country mortality, others dont 5/
INTJ|A recent article by John Burn-Murdoch rightly stressed the horrible US difference 4/ 
INTJ|This represented a drastic reinforcement of an existing trend US life expectancy lagging ever further behind other advanced nations 3/ 
INTJ|Yep Covid killed off a bunch of the more expensive Medicare recipients, improving the programs finances for the next few years. You might call this an act of God — except that America suffered far more deaths than other advanced countries 2/
INTJ|With everything else going on, Fridays release of the Medicare Trustees report didnt get much attention. But it said that the hospital trust fund will probably last longer than previously expected — for a very bad reason 1/ 
INTJ|Electricity, chips and chatbots 
INTJ|The economic outlook is getting even murkier. Time for the Fed to pause and look around 
INTJ|Current policy advice? Dont just do something sit there 9/
INTJ|But inflation expectations look really well anchored. So the Fed probably has space to exercise some discretion 8/ 
INTJ|Lots of people quoting Torsten Slok, who says ~150 basis points. Could be — or could be that plus or minus, um, 150 basis points. Nobody really knows. Good reason to pause and wait for more information, unless youre deeply worried about Fed credibility 7/
INTJ|Now the bank shock. From what I can see, a lot of funds moved from bank deposits to money market funds — which have much stricter liquidity requirements, so serious hit to business lending. Equivalent to significant rate hike 6/
INTJ|Still worried about delayed effects of rate hikes on housing employment and incomes 5/ 
INTJ|Best guess was economy still overheated. But Fed trying to thread a path between Scylla (risk of inflation staying high and maybe even going up) and Charybdis (risk of gratuitous recession) Economy seemed to be barreling along despite rate hikes, but air pockets ahead? 4/
INTJ|Core inflation measures that tried to exclude known transitory/distortionary factors (supercore excludes food, energy, shelter, used cars) more pessimistic than labor costs 3/ 
INTJ|Before banks started exploding, we had seen a substantial decline in underlying inflation — but unclear how far we were from target and whether inflation was still falling or moving sideways 2/
INTJ|So, on vacation — but in the middle of a banking crisis. Will weigh in with a newsletter tomorrow, but where my thinking is right now. The banking mess is, as far as I can tell, sufficient reason for the Fed to pause until we know more 1/
INTJ|Also, public service announcement Im on vacation for 2 weeks. I may have a newsletter Tuesday, but no columns, and hopefully very few . Will be too busy walking around, eating, and drinking wine 3/
INTJ|The point of rate hikes is to cool demand. If bank troubles cool demand, you dont need those rate hikes. If you like, monetary policy is operating through an additional channel — probably mostly commercial real estate — so rates dont need to go as high 2/
INTJ|So Im seeing some people saying that banking problems will cause a recession, and also that financial dominance, by preventing rate hikes, will doom the fight against inflation. You cant believe both things! 1/
INTJ|Schrodingers CPI
INTJ|Two risks are a no landing scenario, in which economy just doesnt cool off, and an air pocket scenario in which past rate hikes finally hit construction employment hard. Absent SVB Fed would probably just keep gradual hiking, maybe even with SVB 3/
INTJ|My story for where we are inflation came down substantially with no significant rise in unemployment, suggesting a near-vertical Phillips curve, but economy is still running too hot to get it down to target. 2/
INTJ|CPI not great but not grim. Supercore — ex food, energy, shelter and used cars — ticked up a bit on 3-mo basis, but its fairly noisy, should be set against wages last week, which were mildly encouraging 1/ 
INTJ|I mean, if you’re totally into crypto, how likely that you’re carefully thinking through the logic of deposit insurance? You haven’t even figured out what money is!
INTJ|Of course I’m boarding a long flight just as this stuff breaks. Will weigh in when I’ve arrived. But on moral hazard I don’t think expectations of a bailout created this mess. The depositors weren’t that smart
INTJ|I think that the risk from it turning out to be systemic after all just trumped the argument that it probably wasn’t.
INTJ|But it is infuriating. At a fundamental level, were arguably talking about a kind of scam a bank that sold itself on false pretenses. Its really part of the larger story of delusion marketing that includes crypto 8/
INTJ|The good news is that the FDIC has seized the bank, so the stockholders have been cleaned out. Unfortunately, there seems likely to be enough systemic spillover that the Feds will probably have to backstop some although maybe not all the uninsured deposits 7/
INTJ|And of course SVB lobbied successfully for a weakening of regulations that might have prevented the blowup — as Lael Brainard warned in real time 6/ 
INTJ|In a deep sense — though not a legal sense — what SVB actually did was a kind of affinity fraud a la Madoff. It managed to convince the VC/startup/crypto etc world that it was one of them, part of their community, and hence trustworthy 5/
INTJ|So what was all the dedicated to global innovation stuff about? Some real business — but largely, I think, a form of marketing a way to sell crypto, startups etc on the idea that SVB was their kind of bank, and hence a place to put large uninsured sums 4/
INTJ|And in fact longer-term securities paid more than short precisely because there was a one-sided risk that what did happen, would happen — that short rates couldnt go down, but could go up. So this wasnt a brilliant investment strategy, just unacknowledged risk-taking 3/
INTJ|SVB did indeed provide services to startups — loans, investment guidance, etc. But that wasnt where it made most of its money. Instead, it basically just attracted deposits and put the funds in long-term securities, a simple carry trade that went very wrong 2/
INTJ|More SVB I think we can learn a lot about what happened from this 2001 Barry Ritholtz interview with SVBs CEO, which describes it as the only bank dedicated to the global innovation sector — which is indeed how it portrayed itself 1/ 
INTJ|What I dont have a sense of is how much this will damage the VC financial ecosystem — or how much the rest of us should care. But — hoping these arent famous last words — this looks at most like a fairly narrow sectoral crisis 14/
INTJ|And because SVB was basically buying agencies and Treasuries, which are safe assets, its failure wont cause anything like the crash in MBS and run on repo that followed the Lehman collapse. Systemic issues much less obvious 13/
INTJ|Maybe the important point is that all of this looks fairly sui generis. Other banks like SVB could be in the same fix — but which are these similar banks? Probably doesnt herald a wave of bank runs 12/
INTJ|Its not at all clear whether SVB was inherently insolvent. The market value of its investments fell when long rates rose, but its earnings may still have been enough to cover interest on its deposits. But big deposits made it vulnerable to a classic bank run 11/
INTJ|The reason is option value short rates can go up but not down. Which means that betting on the spread is risky. If and when short rates go up, youre in trouble. They did, and SVB was. 10/
INTJ|So it was basically a kind of carry trade. The problem is that there was a reason long-term rates were higher than short-term. Wrote about it back in 2008 strongly upward-sloping yield curve is inevitable when short rates are near the zero lower bound 9/ 
INTJ|SVB had little of this. It was sitting on a huge pile of cash, without good places to put it to work. So what it did was put a lot of money into long-term securities, which at the time were paying much higher interest than short-term assets, incl deposits 8/ 
INTJ|Conventional banks also earn money from credit card balances, which is similar but even more so, with a lot of inertia in the customer base 7/
INTJ|Conventional banks make money in part because they know something about/have special relationships with their borrowers. They lend money to businesses and consumers, at above market rates bc theres default risk, which they think they can manage. 6/
INTJ|There were two problems with this business model. First, the bank attracted big accounts, far larger than the 250K insured by the FDIC, making it vulnerable to a classic bank run. Second, it didnt really have any expertise in putting that money to work 5/
INTJ|So what was SVB selling? As far as I can tell, it was just unusually good at cultivating relationships with, um, Silicon Valley, specifically VC. Maybe it should have been called Schmoozing and Vibes Bank 4/
INTJ|To be fair, deposits rose a lot all across the banking system, but SVBs rise was much faster 3/ 
INTJ|SVB was founded 40 years ago, but its big expansion is much more recent, deposits surged during the pandemic 2/ 
INTJ|OK, some very early morning thoughts on SVB, and why it probably isnt a harbinger for the banking system as a whole — why this is unlikely to be another Lehman moment 1/
INTJ|This is basically a clarion call for Biden to mint the coin, or something comparable. You dont get to make demands like this when you narrowly control one house of Congress
INTJ|But right now the data are saying soft landing. Which I guess means that Tuesdays CPI will be awful, given the way things have been going 3/
INTJ|Risks we may be sucker-punched by yet another big revision in wage numbers, and inflation will look problematic. Or we may get hit with a sudden decline in construction jobs as lagged effects of rate hikes hit 2/
INTJ|This is a very good summary of where the labor market seems to be. On every measure except JOLTS job offerings, it basically looks just like the market on the eve of the pandemic. 1/ 
INTJ|Markets seem to think this was a dovish report 
INTJ|As I see it, 4 recent indicators of labor market hotness 1. JOLTS openings 2. quits 3. private openings 4. AHE. The last 3 all suggest substantial cooling
INTJ|My view too. But with the caveat that weve been jerked around by data revisions so much that I take every report on AHE with a whole shaker of salt
INTJ|Why are Republicans still pushing the old nonsense? 
INTJ|Economy probably still running unsustainably hot. I can see the case for 50 from the Fed, but also the case for not, and honestly it probably doesnt matter much. What matters are market expectations about future Fed policy, which will largely be driven by data 3/
INTJ|You might think that Fridays job report will provide clarity. But revisions have been so large lately, especially on wage growth, that well have to take it with a few tablespoons of salt. Also JOLTS now has a terrible response rate 2/
INTJ|I have a few minutes, so some thoughts on tea-leaf reading. JOLTS came in confusing, with openings barely down but quits down substantially. So the labor market either isnt cooling or it is. Fwiw, private job openings measures do suggest cooling 1/
INTJ|And tweeting got results. A representative called and we seem to be up again.
INTJ|Too busy to tweet. But not to vent. Ive been using Venmo for years, but now it wont allow me to make payments. I spent a long time in chat with representatives, and they told me that they cant explain why — or fix it. The software has taken control.
INTJ|Yes, and its the right way to go. But notice that this is only Medicare Part A, hospital insurance. The same approach can deal with the overall social insurance problem, but only with more taxes. Probably cant do it all without hitting some people lt,400K
INTJ|If you were looking at housing starts youd think there was a significant slowdown in process. But employment hasnt declined at all. I honestly dont know quite whats happening, but surely this is a large part of the mystery 2/
INTJ|The most puzzling chart in economics right now. Much speculation about why Fed hikes havent done much to slow the economy, but too much focuses on businesses and consumers, housing is where monetary policy usually has the most traction 1/ 
INTJ|On inflation, fog gets in your eyes 
INTJ|Dear everyone it’s rein in like a horse, not reign in like a monarch
INTJ|And the most important anti-regulation stance is a pledge to prevent federal rules that would block local attempts to, um, regulate housing by allowing only single-family structures 3/
INTJ|Curious fact about that proposal, which says something about the current GOP it mentions regulation only 12 times, compared with 16 for critical race theory and 77 for woke 2/ 
INTJ|Russell Vought is the new Rick Scott Biden going after widely circulated budget proposal that spares Medicare/Social Security but savages Medicaid 1/ 
INTJ|We need a name for conspiracy theories that dont even explain what evil things the conspirators are doing 
INTJ|Of course this is silly. It’s really a Habsburg conspiracy (that’s actually out there) to destroy Russia, restore the Holy Roman Empire, and force everyone to eat schnitzel
INTJ|So I was off Twitter, getting some actual work done, and only recently learned that theres suddenly a popular theory on the right that the whole Ukraine War is Wag the Dog — not really happening. I take this as more evidence that were living in a badly designed simulation.
INTJ|If you ask me, our big prediction problems now dont involve aggregate supply — what were seeing is more or less consistent with a nonlinear Phillips curve — but aggregate demand. Why is spending so resilient? 3/
INTJ|The big Biden stimulus was two years ago, its effects should be receding. The Fed has raised rates 450 basis points, and despite all the talk of financial conditions not responding, mortgage rates — where the rubber usually meets the road — are way up 2/
INTJ|While we shouldnt make too much of one months report, pretty clear that economy is still running too hot, which isnt really a shock given everything else we know. The puzzle — and Im genuinely puzzled, without strong priors or a political axe to grind — is why its so hot 1/
INTJ|So picture might look like this, with unemployment gap on horizontal axis. The problem hasnt been a difficult inflation tradeoff, it has been the resilience of the economy to rate hikes 3/ 
INTJ|What I think/fear is happening significant disinflation came easily, suggesting a steep tradeoff and no need for many years of mass unemployment. But economy has barely cooled off despite rate hikes. 2/
INTJ|Late to this, but yes. Putting all the various indicators together, inflation seems to be moving sideways, and is still unacceptably high. Suggests that the economy remains too hot, and very hard to argue against more Fed hikes.
INTJ|Why the right cant handle the truth about Russias weakness 
INTJ|Im getting a few people saying but the programs will be bankrupt because payroll taxes will fall short of expenses. Yes, SS and Medicare Part A are supported by dedicated taxes. But thats an accounting convention, not a real constraint — and taxes can be increased.
INTJ|Yes, costs will rise. But we dont have to cut benefits 
INTJ|And if you really worry about deficits, as opposed to wanting reasons to kill social insurance, you should be asking how America — which has incredibly high health costs — can bring them down 3/
INTJ|Projections of rising costs depend in large part not on hard truths about demography but on assumed increases in health spending. Recent history doesnt support that pessimism on health costs, in fact, CBO has drastically reduced its own projections 2/ 
INTJ|So were getting the usual suspects showing up to say that Medicare and Social Security cant possibly remain as they are. I should have a newsletter about all this later today, but heres the key chart from CBO 1/ 
INTJ|What this is about (and I invented the phrase!) 2/ 
INTJ|Irish officials in denial 1/ 
INTJ|The tough guy who preceded him 2/ 
INTJ|A tale of two presidents. The one we have 1/ 
INTJ|Obviously lower life expectancy not a good thing dying tends to hurt the quality of life. But it says that were thinking too much about the fiscal side 3/
INTJ|Good reasons to believe that there will be more downward revisions — and not just bc of slowing medical costs. Demographic projections assume a rise in life expectancy at 65 thats becoming questionable 2/
INTJ|More about how predicted future Medicare outlays keep going down. CBO projection from 2009, actual through 2022, current projection — some wonky stuff in 2023 involving treatment of receipts, but as you can see catastrophic predictions have been revised way down 1/ 
INTJ|And one more update, to show how hard it is to project future medical costs — which are the main source of budget doom and gloom. CBO provides spreadsheets on budget projections going back to 2009. Heres how the Medicare projection has changed 10/ 
INTJ|So please, can we not go through all this again? 9/
INTJ|Finally much of the media seems to be back to its old deficit-reporting mode (as Ezra noted back when), presenting anti-social-insurance editorializing — Medicare and Social Security must be reformed — as if it were straight reporting 8/ 
INTJ|So its not unreasonable to believe that we can do a lot of health cost control. And while the demographic drag on the budget isnt small, it isnt gigantic either — lt,3% of GDP. So a future of cost control plus moderate tax increases is arguably feasible 7/
INTJ|Gah. Heres the chart 6/ 
INTJ|Bear in mind that US health costs are much higher than anyone elses — and also that their rate of growth has been slowing 5/
INTJ|The news is that CBO is getting more optimistic about our ability to contain health costs, which is crucial demography alone isnt that big a deal. Heres CBOs chart from last July 4/ 
INTJ|What? Medicares prospects look better than they did before? Ill bet you didnt get that impression from the stories. All you read was that an aging population plus rising health costs will be a financial problem — but that wasnt news 3/
INTJ|CBOs main projections were for 10 years, but it also updated its long-run budget projections. Heres how those projections for Medicare changed since last July 2/ 
INTJ|Last week CBO issued its latest budget projections. And every report I saw conveyed the impression that they were bad news, reinforcing the case that Medicare and Social Security are unsustainable. But thats not what we learned 1/
INTJ|Judging from some reactions to the headline, maybe no dark sarcasm on the opinion page? But what would be the fun in that? 
INTJ|Sad that Roger Waters has become a Putin apologist. But not going to cancel his music 3/ 
INTJ|Cultural reference 2/ 
INTJ|Remarkably, Ive been getting some complaints about my headlines grammar 1/ 
INTJ|Also tricky bc you want to use things you know — used car prices are volatile, official shelter inflation lags — but avoid motivated reasoning, excluding stuff until you get the answer you want. One does ones best.
INTJ|Sunsets are bad. Unless they actually involve the sun setting, preferably over the ocean with a drink in hand 
INTJ|In other words, the data dont actually say that major benefit cuts are inevitable, modest tax hikes plus cost control might be enough. 5/
INTJ|Over the past decade medical costs actually grew much less than expected — ie, these projections shouldnt be taken as gospel. And one way to deal with long-run budget problems is to tackle health costs, which are far higher here than in other advanced countries 4/
INTJ|Yes, an aging population will raise costs, and something will eventually have to be done. But much of the projected cost rise doesnt reflect demography, it reflects an assumption that medical costs will rise rapidly. 3/
INTJ|And entitlement spending is indeed expected to rise substantially in the decades ahead. But important to bear in mind this, from CBO long-run budget outlook 2/ 
INTJ|Were talking about Medicare and Social Security again — thanks, Rick Scott! — and even as Republicans reenact the Monty Python run away scene, some of the Very Serious People are popping up to resume their entitlement-bashing 1/
INTJ|I look at this measure too. One way to see it on a 3-month basis, a year ago it was running 5 points above the Feds target. 2/3 of that excess has now gone away, without any increase in unemployment. But were not all the way there.
INTJ|This headline almost gave me a heart attack — CEA chair, while a fine and important job, would be a serious demotion. But Lael is getting the NEC — and Jared Bernstein the CEA. Congrats to both 
INTJ|Underlying inflation is almost surely way down since mid-2022, but probably still running a point or more above the Feds 2 percent target. The big story is still that disinflation has proved surprisingly easy, but we arent all the way there yet 3/
INTJ|And this tells us nothing about current inflationary pressures. Its the lagged reflection of a rent surge driven largely by work from home — a rent surge that ended many months ago, market rents are now flat or even falling 2/
INTJ|Your regular reminder a lot of this latest inflation number — core even more than headline — reflects shelter 1/ 
INTJ|My baseline view is that the economy is still probably running unsustainably hot, and that inflation is down substantially but probably running above target. Unlikely that well get enough news Tuesday to move that view very much 4/
INTJ|So well get headlines about inflation rising, especially given the BLS change in seasonal adjustment. But whether its actually good or bad news will depend on the details — and may be very hard to discern 3/
INTJ|The key point Some of the temporary factors that were holding inflation down, especially falling used car prices, are probably over. On the other side, official shelter prices are still rising fast, even though market rents are probably falling, because of known lags 2/
INTJ|I suppose I should preregister some views about the upcoming CPI report, so I dont get accused of making excuses when (as seems likely) it shows a significant uptick. Because it probably will — for reasons that tell us little about how were actually doing on inflation 1/
INTJ|So lets not act as if Biden was engaged in some kind of gotcha. For more than three decades Republicans have been trying to eviscerate SS and Medicare whenever they thought they had a political opportunity to do so 10/
INTJ|Lets also add that if you have absolutely no intention of ever cutting Social Security and Medicare, you dont set up a process where the entire programs have to be reapproved every five years. As Biden might say, cmon, man 9/
INTJ|So now we have Rick Scott saying that just because he called for sunsetting Medicare and Social Security he wasnt calling for sunsetting them. Biden used the same words Scott did 8/
INTJ|After the Republican takeover of the House in 2010, Paul Ryan pushed a plan to convert Medicare into a voucher system, although as with privatization he insisted that calling vouchers vouchers was a left-wing smear 7/ 
INTJ|Stepping back a bit, in 1995 Newt Gingrich shut down the government in an attempt to force Bill Clinton to make major cuts in Medicare and Medicaid 6/ 
INTJ|In 2005 George W. Bush tried to move forward with that plan, although conservatives insisted that calling it privatization (which polled badly) was a left-wing smear, meanwhile Cato quietly changed the name of its project 5/
INTJ|Cato also created a Project on Social Security Privatization, which drew up plans for that happy event 4/ 
INTJ|In response the Cato Institute called for a Leninist approach (their term), setting the stage to exploit future crises to dismantle Social Security 3/ 
INTJ|Ronald Reagan tried to make significant cuts in Social Security in 1981, but backed down in the face of a huge public backlash 2/ 
INTJ|Amid the desperate attempts by Fox News and its subsidiary, the Republican Party, to insist that Bidens true claims about GOP efforts to cut Medicare and Social Security are false, worth remembering some history 1/
INTJ|So many statistical problems right now! We already knew core was less useful bc of used cars, long lag in reflecting market rents, and health insurance quirks. Now seasonals? I think inflation has fallen substantially but is still above target. But boy are things foggy
INTJ|Fun piece, and nice to be given credit for the phrase. But I actually only popularized the term immaculate transfer, it came originally from John Williamson 
INTJ|Chicken prices have been falling since September. So one big question is now resolved
INTJ|British CO2 per capita is back down to what it was in the 50s - the 1850s.
INTJ|Heres 6-month inflation annualized from start of Korean war and start of Biden admin 2/ 
INTJ|Revisiting some of the dire inflation/unemployment predictions from the summer and early fall, which make amazing reading. Obviously story isnt over yet, but its really looking like Joe Gagnons Korean War analogy a large but brief inflation spike 1/ 
INTJ|So what youre saying is that we havent had that spirit here since 1969?
INTJ|Nonsupervisory wages (longer time series). After a fairly brief spike, back to wage growth similar to previous business cycle peaks. Looking pretty transitory 
INTJ|Obviously they just wanted to see how we would react. That is, it was a trial balloon. I assume 53 million people have already made this joke, although oddly I havent seen it.
INTJ|But some are highly confident in their ignorance
INTJ|Overall, the track record of the past two years looks pretty good. And if underlying inflation stays stuck at 3%, were going to have to ask how much were willing to pay to get it back down to 2 5/
INTJ|On the other hand, probably some room for margin compression, and productivity reviving. So inflation in the 2-3% range for a while looks quite possible 4/
INTJ|Obviously inflation has been big problem, although diminishing. Ive learned not to get too excited about monthly earnings numbers but the latest are more or less consistent with the ECI wage growth well off its peak, but still 1-1.5% above level consistent with 2% inflation 3/
INTJ|We should take todays employment report with a grain of salt — lots of people who know these numbers well warned in advance of statistical noise. But its clear that we have, in fact, been experiencing a Biden boom 2/ 
INTJ|I dont think anything Ive written in the past year has generated as much hate mail as this newsletter saying that we werent in a recession 1/ 
INTJ|The hits just coming against Team Stagflation. Remember when quiet quitting was going to keep inflation high? Obviously the news wont always be good, there will be some disappointing numbers eventually. But its been a good stretch for optimists.
INTJ|People have been saying Goldilocks, but I think that gets the metaphor wrong. Growthability for growth plus price stability?
INTJ|Now were debating how many modest rate hikes are needed to produce moderate economic cooling, which may or may not involve some rise in the unemployment rate. Serious and hard questions, but apocalypse not 2/
INTJ|Reading the Fed Kremlinology, and I understand why people parse these things carefully. But step back and consider how toned down the debate has become. Just the other day influential economists were insisting that we needed to go through something like this 1/ 
INTJ|Calculations of underlying inflation are basically about how far weve slid down that green arrow. They arent irrelevant, because they offer guidance about how much more, if at all, the Fed needs to tighten. But the big debate about inflation dynamics looks largely over 10/
INTJ|Does anyone seriously want to dispute the proposition that recent inflation dynamics look a lot more like that last picture than like the 80s redux? I mean, most core measures look like this one (chosen because its easy to conjure up from FRED) 9/ 
INTJ|But anyway, the soft landing story was that went up with shocking speed could also come down with shocking speed. 8/ 
INTJ|Ive argued all along that this view required rejecting standard macroeconomics after all, sticky inflation expectations are what lie behind textbook models of clockwise spirals in unemployment and inflation, and expectations seemed anchored 7/
INTJ|The view Larry Summers and other have been propounding is that despite the speed with which inflation shot up, disinflation would be a slow, grinding process comparable to what happened in the 1980s, with what appeared to be a high sacrifice ratio 6/ 
INTJ|As in the previous picture, what had looked like a flat Phillips curve pre-2020 suddenly seemed very steep, with core inflation (by any measure) shooting up rapidly as the economy overheated 5/
INTJ|Here u is unemployment and u is some version of full employment — with expectations seemingly stable, I dont think we can talk about the NAIRU. And I use the ratio because in a pandemic-disrupted environment full employment may move around 4/
INTJ|The main question seems to me to be what disinflation requires — which is closely connected to why inflation rose so fast. At this point my working hypothesis is nonlinearity inflation responds much more to demand when the economy is hot. Something like this 3/ 
INTJ|But Id argue that efforts to estimate underlying inflation, while of some value, are currently missing a lot of the point. If an inflation measure can change as fast as various core measures have lately, in what sense is it even underlying? 2/
INTJ|Some further notes on inflation in the wake of the ECI report. We can quibble about details on the numbers, but two things seem clear compensation growth has fallen substantially, but is still probably too high to be consistent with 2 percent inflation 1/ 
INTJ|I think we’re approaching the point at which Team Stagflation will have to do what Team Transitory did a while back admit that they got it wrong, and try to figure out why. 
INTJ|Theres light at the beginning of the tunnel — which is really, really needed 
INTJ|And come on, people, weve been discussing this possibility since 2011. No excuse for making elementary conceptual mistakes 5/
INTJ|In effect, the govt broadly defined as Treasury+Fed would be doing exactly the same borrowing as before — except that the Fed rather than Treasury would be selling securities to the private sector. Zero inflation impact 4/
INTJ|The other is that the coin would be printing money and inflationary. No. Its true that the Fed would have to release funds if Treasury drew on a coin-backed account, but this wouldnt have to increase the monetary base, it could be offset by selling Fed-held securities 3/
INTJ|1 argument is theyre gimmicky and undignified. Yes, they are. So is having a financial crisis because a faction in Congress refuses to allow the govt to pay bills it has already incurred. You dont refuse to wear a helmet in a construction zone bc you think it looks dorky 2/
INTJ|Im not writing much about Mint the Coin etc, bc I think the Biden plan is to give Rs as much rope as possible to hang themselves, while keeping their contingency plans quiet. But I do think I should say something about 2 bad arguments against the coin and other strategies 1/
INTJ|I endorse this thread. You really have to work hard not to find this report encouraging.
INTJ|And the ECI came in cool — 4 percent annualized, 3.2 excluding incentive paid. Good news for Team Soft Landing. Unfortunately too early for a drink.
INTJ|Aha. Good to know. Fewer problems with interpreting tomorrows data.
INTJ|This is not to wave it away. If the ECI comes in hot, this will give Team Soft Landing pause. But in a fast-moving environment, even what used to seem like trivial data lags can pose problems of interpretation 5/
INTJ|The ECI, being 4th v 3rd quarter, is roughly a measure for the 3 months ending November — which means, given how fast things seem to be moving, that it could miss a lot of recent disinflation. 4/
INTJ|Many (not all) of these measures have fallen off a cliff (in which case its not clear how underlying they are, but never mind). In the measure shown above, the 3 months ending in Dec. were a lot lower than the 3 months ending in November 3/
INTJ|The ECI comes out only quarterly, which is annoying, but also means that its lagging data. Many of us trying to assess underlying inflation have lately been focused on 3-month rates of change, which matched up with quarterly data. But 2/
INTJ|Like many economic observers, Im waiting anxiously for tomorrows release of the Employment Cost Index. But there may be a big problem of interpretation, illustrated below (Ill explain in a minute) 1/ 
INTJ|Utility post 
INTJ|I dont know who came up with this idea, but it surely wasnt anyone who knows anything about international monetary economics 5/
INTJ|Argentine exports are basically all agriculture, More than half Brazils are manufactures or fuel. So shocks to the world economy likely to cause big changes in equilibrium real exchange rate 4/
INTJ|Argentina sends more to Brazil, because Brazils economy is larger — but still only 15%. And the two countries structure of exports is very different 3/
INTJ|A shared currency may make sense between economies that are each others major trading partners and are similar enough that they wont face large asymmetrical shocks. So, heres the destination of Brazils exports 2/ 
INTJ|What with everything else going on, havent commented on proposed currency union between Argentina and Brazil. But its a nice opportunity to apply the theory of Optimum Currency Areas — which tells us that its a terrible idea 1/ 
INTJ|My hope is that people who were right about inflation — and got a lot of justified credit for making that call — wont try to hold on to their glory days by denying the growing evidence that the inflation surge is behind us 10/ 
INTJ|We are still waiting for Godot, I mean the Employment Cost Index, which might (or might not) give some new justification for pessimism. But as Joey Politano says, the available data suggest deceleration 9/ 
INTJ|You could argue that the textbook model is all wrong, and inflation will be sticky for other reasons. But most of the data seem to show inflation falling fast, and attempts to deny the good news are getting increasingly contorted 8/
INTJ|Textbook macro says that inflation can become entrenched via expectations. But medium- and long-term inflation expectations never rose much, and are now back to roughly pre pandemic levels 7/ 
INTJ|Team Stagflation nonetheless argues that inflation will remain high, that bringing it down will require an extended period of high unemployment, as happened in the 1980s. And of course they could be right. But whats their theory of the case? 6/
INTJ|At this point the big surge in domestic spending is behind us, with nominal spending growth rapidly slowing to rates more or less consistent with target inflation 5/ 
INTJ|But now the argument is between what we might call Team Stagflation and Team Soft Landing. Many of the same players, but in many ways a role reversal in arguments 4/
INTJ|Second, the current inflation debate is very different from the one that took place in 2021. Then, Team Transitory argued that despite large fiscal stimulus we wouldnt see a big rise in inflation, we were wrong, and have admitted that 3/
INTJ|Headline inflation is actually being held down by some clearly one-off things, like falling gas prices, but also being exaggerated by shelter prices that reflect a rent surge that ended many months ago. Overall its more or less a wash, and the disinflation is real 2/
INTJ|Some notes on inflation. First, clearing up a misconception no, measures like supercore that exclude food, energy, shelter and used cars arent finding disinflation by throwing out the inflation 1/ 
INTJ|Fwiw, PCE-based measures of core inflation ~3% over past 3 months, and part of that is shelter. So unless we get a really terrible ECI report, everything is coming up soft landing 
INTJ|Thanks for suggestions. Cleared cache and it seems to be back.
INTJ|So am I the only person who has been unable to work with BLS databases for the past couple of days? When I click Get data it just blanks out my selection.
INTJ|We can talk about possible future recession, and about how underlying inflation may be higher than headline. But thats speculation rather than reporting, and arguable at the very least. Hard to argue against the proposition that media have missed the pretty good reality 2/
INTJ|So, if your picture of the economy came entirely from headlines and cable chyrons — which is probably true for many — would you know that the economy has grown 6.7 percent under Biden so far and inflation for the past 6 months was 1.9 percent? 1/
INTJ|Notably, Republicans rate current economic conditions as worse than in June 1980, when unemployment was 7.6 percent and inflation 14 percent 2/
INTJ|Obviously a rhetorical question. A plurality of voters believes were in a recession, they got that notion from somewhere 1/
INTJ|Oh my. A wonderful scholar. His classic The dynamo and the computer, about how it takes time for businesses to learn what to do with technology, shaped decades of economic analysis
INTJ|Obviously Germany cant have AFVs named Rommel or von Manstein. But in a way continuing the WW2 tradition of Panzers and Tigers is a bit like that. They could honor virtues, like the UK Challenger. Or cultural traditions. Id be terrified to face an armored Currywurst
INTJ|Totally irrelevant question Why are German tanks named after cats, while US tanks are named after generals? Also, given lamentable US history of naming military bases after Confederate traitors, how did we end up fighting WW2 with tanks named after William Tecumseh Sherman?
INTJ|All that said, very happy to see this kind of work being done. Traditional core inflation has performed badly lately, and we need to be exploring new approaches 9/
INTJ|I say this even though I want to believe that inflation has rolled over. Its clearly way down, but a mechanical approach throws out data that might give reason for caution, say on wages 8/
INTJ|E.g., a smoothing approach interprets any sustained downturn as permanent — so it ends up saying that the Great Depression was over by 1935. I actually worry Eeckhouts approach may be doing a milder version of this now, over-interpreting favorable recent inflation shocks 7/
INTJ|A parallel that immediately occurred to me is estimating potential GDP. It can seem appealing to use a statistical smoothing procedure like Hedrick-Prescott, which sometimes produces plausible results. But we also know that it can go badly wrong at times 6/
INTJ|On the other hand, the filter also throws out information. The dynamics of, say, official food and shelter price indexes are different in known ways, applying a common smoothing approach to the overall index means ignoring what we know about sectors 5/
INTJ|What does Eeckhouts procedure add? It doesnt throw out data before past 3 months. Maybe more important, artisanal inflation measures can tempt analysts into choosing measures that tell them what they want to hear. So theres something to be said for a hands-free filter 4/
INTJ|In fact, most practical analysts are using a variety of methods to try and extract the inflation signal from the noise, typically looking at 3-month changes in an index that excludes volatile stuff like energy and stuff with known long lags, mainly shelter 3/
INTJ|First off, I basically agree with Eeckhouts conclusion underlying inflation has fallen fast, although not quite ready to say that its 2 percent. Also agree with the general point about the need to smooth but not too much monthly is too noisy, annual too far behind reality 2/
INTJ|Ive been a bit behind on commenting on this widely cited recent analysis, but thought I might still have something to contribute. Warning very wonkish, not for normal humans 1/
INTJ|Well, it looks as if the Riders of Rohan will be coming to save Gondor after all. (PS Im not actually a LOTR fan) 
INTJ|PS My broadly similar take from a few months ago 
INTJ|During my year in the government, my inbox was full of documents labeled SECRET NOFORN NOCONTRACT PROPIN ORCON. At least 95 percent contained nothing that hadnt already been reported in the Washington Post.
INTJ|Related getting a lot of pushback on the latest column from people saying debt will be a huge problem bc of much higher interest rates. But no good reason to believe that will happen 
INTJ|Olivier and I are on the same page. Once inflation is tamed — which seems to be happening surprisingly fast — well be back in an era of low rates and excess savings 
INTJ|Now, some in the media are visibly trying to bring back the Very Serious People environment — kind of the way some on the political side are trying to bring back but her emails. But I dont think it will work. And if it doesnt, GOP debt blackmail will be much weakened 6/
INTJ|Oh, and the government spending creates inflation trope kind of missed its moment, with the 2021-22 inflation surge looking, um, transitory 5/ 
INTJ|More subtly, long-term debt projections have come way down, still not rosy, but far less alarming than they were circa 2011. More about this soon. And the whole deficit-scold movement, while it still exists, has receded into the background 4/
INTJ|But a dozen years have passed since Bowles and Simpson predicted a fiscal crisis within 2 years absent drastic action, it didnt happen, and despite recent Fed-driven increases interest rates are about the same now as they were when B-S were making their dire predictions 3/
INTJ|Back in 2011, there was a bizarre elite consensus that we were in a fiscal crisis, as Ezra Klein pointed out at the time, this consensus was so strong that the media dropped the conventions of reportorial objectivity and openly sided with the deficit scolds 2/
INTJ|According to Jeff Stein, the Biden admin strategy on the debt ceiling is to stare Rs down make no concessions and dare them to provoke a crisis. I hope it works, if it does, one main reason will be the near-extinction of the Very Serious People 1/ 
INTJ|Well get more data in the weeks ahead, but at this point the burden of proof lies on anyone claiming that we had more than a, well, transitory inflation spike thats mostly behind us 6/
INTJ|Recent wage growth running about the same as late 90s and just before 2007-9 recession. Doesnt exactly scream wage-price spiral! 5/
INTJ|What about wages? Running hotter than eve of the pandemic. But heres a longer view, using nonsupervisory wages (longer time series) 4/ 
INTJ|But anyway, the truth is striking. Heres 3-month supercore excluding food energy shelter and used cars 3/ 
INTJ|Several reasons for this. Too many media reports focus on yoy inflation, so miss the big turn. Traditional core inflation still reflecting rent increases from a year ago. And asymmetric reporting breathless coverage of rising inflation, disinflation not so much 2/
INTJ|One thing Ive been noticing in my correspondence is how many people think inflation is still running wild, the big deceleration in the 2nd half of 2022 hasnt broken through to public consciousness 1/
INTJ|In which Jamie Dimon of all people gives me the opportunity for some bad jokes along with the analysis 
INTJ|Ok, media, where’s the beef?
INTJ|Making the debt ceiling story as simple as I can. But its difficult to get people to understand something when their political posturing depends on not understanding it 
INTJ|I was curious to see how the fire-and-brimstone inflation crowd would react to improving data. To my surprise and slight disappointment, many of them seem to be admitting that a soft landing is possible 3/
INTJ|Prices moderating everywhere, wage growth still elevated but moderating in 5 districts. Goes along with BLS, Atlanta Fed, Indeed etc. 2/
INTJ|I havent seen a lot of attention to the latest Beige Book, but it does seem to confirm other narratives, especially about moderating inflation 1/ 
INTJ|Fwiw, core PPI telling the same story as almost every other indicator inflation rolled over in the 2nd half of 2022 
INTJ|Obviously weve had problems, and would do things differently with the benefit of hindsight. But does this outcome really look like a catastrophe? 8/
INTJ|Maybe new data will make the picture look worse in a few months. But right now it looks as if we achieved rapid recovery at the cost of maybe 20 months of elevated inflation. 7/
INTJ|Meanwhile, we seem to have avoided the scarring many feared, with the labor market recovering to pre-crisis levels far faster than it did after the financial crisis 6/ 
INTJ|And heres average hourly earnings, skipping the period when pandemic compositional effects caused huge distortions 5/ 
INTJ|Heres supercore inflation — ex food, energy, shelter (which we know is very lagged) and used cars 4/ 
INTJ|But now inflation seems to be coming down as fast as it went up. The new Team Transitory warns that this improvement wont last — but its getting harder to make that case 3/
INTJ|The opening salvo was the American Rescue Plan, which came in for immense criticism as the most irresponsible fiscal policy in 50 years. Soaring inflation seemed to vindicate the critics 2/
INTJ|Were coming up on the 2nd anniversary of Bidens inauguration, and I have a few (not very original) thoughts about his economic policy 1/
INTJ|I guess sticky prices arent, at least lately 2/
INTJ|Noodling around on inflation. Of all the measures of core, the one that comes closest to the underlying economic concept is sticky prices. They look like this 1/ 
INTJ|Getting hard to stay grim 
INTJ|Jason Furman doing the same calculation 
INTJ|At this point the case for rate hikes has a real one-eyed-bearded-man-with-a-limp feel — you have to use a weirdly narrow measure to still see an inflation problem. Heres a more normal measure, 3-mo rate of change 
INTJ|So probably somewhere between 140 and 150 million? 3/
INTJ|63 million on Medicare, 89 million on Medicaid, but there are around 12 million dual-enrolled. So thats about 140 million. Most Social Security recipients are also on Medicare, but some people retire as early as 62, so there are some not yet getting Medicare 2/
INTJ|Utility post How many people depend on Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security? We have total enrollment, but these numbers involve a lot of double counting 1/ 
INTJ|Grossly unfair, McCarthy isnt in any real sense part of the leadership
INTJ|Over the past 3 mos, wages growing 4.1%. Underlying inflation now under 3? Wait for more data, obv, but looking shockingly good 2/
INTJ|Relevant to yesterdays report on wages in 2018-19 AHE grew 3.1%, core prices 1.9% 1/ 
INTJ|Right now, both wage and price data suggest an economy not far above target inflation — with 3.5% unemployment! Ultra-soft landing territory, almost too good to believe. Cant they release these reports in the evening, so we can drink either in celebration or sorrow? 2/
INTJ|At this point Im starting to feel as if the BLS is just messing with our heads (not really, theyre doing the best they can, but still). Not just volatile monthly numbers, but big revisions causing huge volatility even in 3 or 6 month averages 1/
INTJ|But those of us who saw it early were ridiculed for being shrill
INTJ|More seriously, will there be anyone with whom to make a deal? Biden may have to mint the coin or use some other exotic strategy bc theres no alternative 4/
INTJ|But you cant shame House Rs into avoiding a financial crisis if, when we hit the ceiling, theyre on the 600th ballot in a still unsuccessful attempt to elect a Speaker 3/
INTJ|In particular, I was baffled by the failure of Democrats to use the lame duck to raise the debt ceiling. Maybe the idea was that Rs could be shamed into avoiding a crisis later this year 2/
INTJ|Like many others, Im experiencing a fair amount of MAGAfreude — pleasure in watching horrible Republicans destroy each other. But there may be collateral damage 1/
INTJ|Well, still a hot labor market. Not as hot as it was at the peak, but high levels of quits in particular make it hard to argue for a Fed pause. Sometimes the data dont tell you what you want to hear.
INTJ|Final point most war-making resources on both sides effectively immune to attack Russia is big, UKR supplied by the West. How does this thing end? 8/
INTJ|On the other hand, theres a benefit to avoiding destructive strikes on the energy grid etc. So the drone war is a battle of attrition, unclear whos winning 7/
INTJ|The Ukraine war lessons go both ways. Even if UKR shoots down most drones, its using expensive resources to do so. 6/
INTJ|So the standard view that strategic bombing failed until late misses its crucial role in consuming German military resources 5/
INTJ|Notably, Allied air attacks on Germany didnt take a large toll on production until 1944 — but they did force Germany to devote huge resources to air defense, at the expense of other fronts 4/
INTJ|Even battles like Kursk or D-Day destroyed only a few days military production for the losing side. What mattered was resources, most of which on both sides went to the air war 3/
INTJ|Even before the war I learned a lot from Phillips OBriens take on WW2, which emphasized materiel rather than famous battles 2/ 
INTJ|Not about economics or politics, at least directly, but I thought this was interesting and ties into how Ive been trying to understand the Ukraine War 1/ 
INTJ|Ive seen jokes about Liz Cheney as speaker, but seriously why cant this end with 7 sane Republicans joining Democrats to elect someone who isnt totally despicable?
INTJ|Politico, 2014

INTJ|Ungated version 3/ 
INTJ|Paper here 2/ 
INTJ|And I found the reference — not Martin Baily but a comment by Bill Nordhaus on a 1976 paper by Baily 1/ 
INTJ|Im cross-posting everything on Mastodon. So far its a very inadequate substitute for this site, mainly because not enough people there. But getting better by the day, it will be time-consuming and awkward to replace Twitter, but we will do as needs Musk
INTJ|Its precisely because inflation isnt immaculate that we worry about things like supply shocks and wage-price spirals — and why estimating the cost of disinflation is so hard 6/
INTJ|The late John Williamson mocked the contrary view as the doctrine of immaculate transfer. Theres a similar doctrine of immaculate inflation, which has nominal demand driving inflation without somehow affecting the incentives of workers and firms 5/
INTJ|But exporters and importers dont care about accounting identities. They care about costs and opportunities, something that affects these, like the real exchange rate, must shift to make the identities hold 4/
INTJ|There was a similar debate over the balance of payments back in the 1980s. The trade balance must equal the difference between savings and investment, and some argued that this made exchange rates and competitiveness irrelevant 3/
INTJ|A business that raises its prices doesnt do so because the Fed has increased the money supply. The chain of events that leads to that price rise may have started with the Fed, but the firm is responding to its own market conditions 2/
INTJ|Continuing this discussion. Again, Olivier is tapping into an important point often missed in monetary/macroeconomics in the end, it all comes down to individual motives and decisions 1/
INTJ|Tyranny in action 
INTJ|And of course all of this extremely relevant if were trying to figure out how hard disinflation will be in the near future 8/
INTJ|Staggered wage-setting, and in a hot labor market everyone trying to get ahead of everyone else — with inflation possibly getting entrenched if everyone expected it to persist 7/
INTJ|FWIW, the 1968 Phelps paper that simultaneously and independently introduced the natural rate hypothesis — and I think much better than Friedmans — worked pretty much that way 6/
INTJ|The more or less painless 1985 Bruno disinflation in Israel was pretty much exactly that all the major parties agreed to stop trying to leapfrog each other, and inflation came down right away 5/
INTJ|Much better if we could get collective agreement by everyone to sit down without stopping the game. Thats hard to achieve, but not always impossible 4/
INTJ|Controlling inflation by inducing a recession is like stopping the action on the field until everyone sits down again. It works, but at a cost 3/
INTJ|I think this came from Martin Baily in the 70s. Anyway, one way to think about inflation is that its like a sports event where everyone stands up to get a better view of the action — which is collectively self-defeating 2/
INTJ|A very good point from Olivier, but the replies make it clear that many people dont get it. Maybe an old analogy can help clarify 1/
INTJ|Almost surely the Musk fan version of HODLing
INTJ|When you want to do scathing muckraking but cant 
INTJ|Btw, clear family resemblance to the shipping container crisis of 2021-2. But more to come 7/
INTJ|Mainly, though, a system that normally works pretty well ran into a, um, perfect storm. No doubt some bad actors, there must be some way to blame Musk or someone. But not a morality play 6/
INTJ|Now clearly SW had an inadequate scheduling system, there may be a story of corporate penny-pinching here. But hardly unique 5/
INTJ|Worth noting that before this happened, SW was ranked #1 in customer satisfaction (in basic economy — it doesnt have business class) 4/ 
INTJ|But p2p has advantages in normal conditions. In fact, other airlines have to some extent been moving back to the direct flight system over time 3/
INTJ|A lot of the issue was apparently that SW does point-to-point, not hub and spoke. This left planes and especially crews stranded far more than other airlines 2/
INTJ|So, Im doing some homework on the Southwest disaster — probably more tomorrow. And I hate to say this, but it doesnt look like a simple morality play about greedy capitalists 1/

INTJ|So owning a Tesla was, to be crude but I think accurate, a way to say Im rich but Im woke. Lots to criticize and ridicule there, but it was the marketing strategy 5/

INTJ|Now the pessimists are working overtime to explain away the good news. To be fair, always a good idea to be cautious. But recent reports really have been encouraging 2/
INTJ|Im not going to try picking over the entrails of the latest inflation report. Just noting the role reversal. A year ago inflation optimists kept trying to explain away the bad news 1/
INTJ|So Ukraine must lose, and Russia win, to vindicate the worship of thuggishness 6/

INTJ|Heres what I get (using Zillow in place of BLS shelter) 
INTJ|A quick note about core inflation. Im aware of at least 6 measures Traditional Median Trimmed mean Supercore (traditional ex shelter) Superdupercore (super also ex used cars) Furman core (use market rents for shelter) They all tell different stories!
INTJ|Yes. Or use market rents instead of BLS. But even supercore excluding shelter is running at 3.6% over past 3 months if you also exclude used cars. Still curb our enthusiasm time, although dire Volcker scenarios look ever less likely
INTJ|But if inflation isnt entrenched — and probably wont be, given low headline rates — isnt it likely that cooling demand will bring inflation down fast? 8/
INTJ|Alternative notion of underlying is inflation caused by general excess demand rather than temporary disruptions. Wage data and most core measures show some of that 7/
INTJ| one-year expectations elevated, but thats just lagged gas prices, medium-term not at all, and no sign future inflation seeping into price and wage setting 6/ 
INTJ|Standard macro says that inflation can be self-perpetuating — that is, persist even in the face of above-normal unemployment — if entrenched in expectations. But 5/
INTJ|More substantively many people trying to estimate underlying inflation. But less clarity about what that means, and this matters 4/
INTJ|Maybe something similar on disinflation? Obv we dont know that, but past underprediction of inflation is no guarantee of future performance 3/

INTJ|Probably also related to the nationalist aspects of Biden climate policy, which were necessary for domestic politics, but they may invoke security if challenged by the WTO 3/
INTJ|I assume that this is less about the substance of those particular tariffs than about principle. Biden is taking a much more aggressive stance toward China than most people realize 2/

INTJ|Do we know that this is right? No. But rethinking along these lines looks to me like a better approach than trying to keep adjusting the core inflation Phillips curve to fit awkward data 11/
INTJ|Thats pretty much what has happened — after they wrote this, so it counts as a successful prediction. And it suggests that the worsened unemployment-inflation tradeoff wont persist 10/
INTJ|What a model along these lines would predict is a jump in overall prices, with very high but temporary inflation in some sectors. Also a lot of churn as labor reallocated to expanding sectors 9/
INTJ|Guerrieri et al basically assume a big shift in the composition of demand, plus sluggish reallocation and downward wage and maybe price rigidity. They worried a lot about optimal policy, but just focus on description 8/
INTJ|So what if an aggregative Phillips curve is all wrong for the pandemic era? I was trying to think through a model, and realized that it had already been largely written 7/ 
INTJ|Another anomaly huge but temporary inflation surges in sectors usually included in core inflation, notably housing rents 6/

INTJ|Heres what happened to a wage Phillips curve using ECI wages and salaries. The line is the fitted slope 2000-2020Q1, the red dots 2021-2022 (skipping the height of the pandemic disruption) 4/ 
INTJ|But it feels more and more like Ptolemaic astronomy, relying on a growing number of epicycles to deal with the anomalies. Two examples of what I mean 3/
INTJ|Most policy-oriented macro ppl entered the pandemic using what we might call a core inflation Phillips curve — inflation depending on slack, but with volatile stuff carved out. And were still trying to fit events into that framework 2/
INTJ|A very wonkish and probably too long thread on inflation. Not predictions, but to talk about my sense that we (myself included) have been working with the wrong model given the current situation 1/
INTJ|The experience with this site is deteriorating by the day. I am now on both Mastodon and Post and Triple-posting will be a pain, but will try for a while at least.
INTJ|Getting more and more promoted , obviously a desperate attempt to increase revenue. But ludicrously badly targeted. Not just celebrity obsessed, but celebrities I’ve never heard of
INTJ|Meanwhile, gas prices down over the year. Remember when $5 gas was the main R talking point? The thing is, if inflation does come under control without a severe recession, Biden econ policy will look very good in retrospect 3/
INTJ|Now, Im not personally confident in that view, oddly, Wall Street economists are at this point more firmly Team Transitory than I am. Worried about wages, although open to arguments that worry is overstated. 2/
INTJ|Odd that Im seeing almost no commentary on this AMs PPI report. More or less in line with expectations, but core consistent with view that the inflation surge is mostly behind us 1/ 
INTJ|In general, Im coming to the conclusion that we — me too — have been way too quick to jump into data interpretation without thinking enough about wage and price dynamics in the face of disruptions. This time really is different 8/
INTJ|A further point rapid slowdown in rent shows that fast rise in recent past was NOT an expectations-driven surge, in fact suggests inflation expectations still anchored 7/
INTJ|Compare Zillow with BLS shelter and you see rents rapidly becoming a source of DISinflation. At a guess wages not there yet. But maybe coming? 6/ 
INTJ|The Indeed data from Nick Bunker is yoy growth, would be very curious to see 3-month nos if they can seasonally adjust. We know that the rent numbers are really striking 5/
INTJ|Something similar although less drastic may be happening with wages averages rising bc of a hot market some months ago, new wage deals up at a more moderate pace 4/
INTJ|At this point many observers are aware that rising official shelter prices largely reflect a surge in rents last year, largely driven (we think) by work from home. Recent market rent inflation is low, maybe even negative 3/
INTJ|In both cases, average market prices lag well behind new contracts many apartments are leased and workers hired for a year, so market conditions take a while to show up in average measures 2/
INTJ|This is very interesting and reminds me to post something about an issue thats been on my mind parallels between shelter and wage inflation 1/

INTJ|I was wrong about the politics, because inflation created bad feelings. But maybe not as much as pundits expected. About 60% of voters who said the economy was not so good voted for Democrats 6/ 
INTJ|But another measure, from the Conference Board, tells a very different story current conditions down a bit, but only to ~2017 levels 5/

INTJ|OK, that was a bit harder to do than it should have been Mastodon is slow, and I havent figured out how to paste text. But given whats happening to this site, it may be where I go, at least for now 
INTJ|Note that if this emerging consensus is right, US economic policy over the past 2 years will look pretty good in hindsight 6/
INTJ|Also growing belief that Phillips curve is nonlinear inflation responds a lot to rising demand when economy running hot, but also probably falls rapidly when economy cools off 5/
INTJ|Shelter in turn dominates various measures of core inflation. GS chart, note that shelter dominates median inflation even when it’s not the median — see note at the bottom 4/ 
INTJ|It’s more than one good inflation print. Growing realization that a lot of official inflation is driven by shelter, which is very much a lagging indicator. Here’s BLS rent v Zillow (which itself is a 3m moving average, and hence lags a bit) 3/ 
INTJ|So, I’ve been noticing a real change in tone in online discussion of inflation (by sophisticated observers). Suddenly more talk about inflation coming down pretty fast, maybe without a recession. Why, and is it justified? 2/
INTJ|OK, gonna start dual-posting on Twitter and Mastodon. Let’s see if this works. 1/
INTJ|Not just wrong about Bitcoin, but wrong about gold — its price isnt determined by inflation, but by real interest rates. It surged in the deflationary environment after 2008 because real returns on everything else were low
INTJ|Jasons original calc relied only on Zillow, which has lagged the other measures in finding drastic disinflation in rents.
INTJ|Killjoys. The other day a sign on 295 said Get your head out of your apps 
INTJ|What I think we can say is that measured inflation seems highly likely to fall considerably. Going to enjoy watching Rs claim that they deserve credit, because of their policy of investigating Hunter Biden 4/
INTJ|Plus the narrower the index, the more it can be swayed by idiosyncratic stuff, like how you measure health insurance costs. And by the way, if true shelter inflation can surge and plunge the way it has, what is core anyway? 3/
INTJ|Some people looking at inflation ex food, energy and shelter. But Ive grown reluctant to look at indexes that exclude more and more stuff. Much risk of motivated reasoning — results can depend on exactly what you exclude 2/
INTJ|Want to come back to this. Far too soon to declare victory over inflation. But good reason to believe that inflation will come down significantly even if there isnt a recession, as market rents get reflected in official shelter costs 1/
INTJ|And I have a Mastodon site ready to roll 2/

INTJ|OK, if Twitter dies soon — suddenly looking like a real possibility — I do have a Mastodon account here And columns and newsletters can be found here 
INTJ|Actually not, especially when compared with wages. Avg price ratio to ordinary workers wages, normalized to Sept. 2022 2/ 
INTJ|Catching up on Trumps speech — and noticing that they cant quit gas prices, even though theyre not under policy control and have fallen a lot. Gas prices have reached their highest level in history 1/ 
INTJ|Thanks Jason! Was hoping someone would do this calculation, rather than having to do it myself. The obvious implication is that persistent inflation may be a data artifact, that the economy isnt all that overheated after all.
INTJ|Bidens landmark climate legislation wasnt a major campaign issue, which is very good news 
INTJ|Zillow is smoothed and seasonally adjusted, so this does say that rental inflation has fallen off a cliff. Will take months to show up in BLS shelter index, but core inflation is set for a major decline

INTJ|As I understood it, the traditional pattern, while partly about gerrymandering, was also about racial geography high concentration of Black voters in urban areas, where many of their votes were wasted in D supermajorities, while Rs won elsewhere with narrower majorities 2/
INTJ|OK, question for voting mavens. It seems the traditional R structural advantage, in which the GOP can take the House with a minority of the popular vote, has vanished. But why? Nate Cohn had an enlightening discussion, but I want more on one issue 1/ 
INTJ|And no, its not about freedom. Were not talking about lockdowns and restrictions at this point, just about lifesaving shots that DeSantis deterred people from getting. Truly awesome 6/
INTJ|Why didnt DeSantis pay a price for this? Because Covid victims die out of the public eye, offscreen as it were. A resident of Florida is ~20X as likely to die gratuitously from Covid as a resident of NY is to be murdered, but crime makes headlines while other deaths dont 5/
INTJ|Adjusted for population, the Florida-equivalent death toll was FL 59,170 CA 39,217 NY 39,551 So states that didnt have governors promoting Covid disinformation and anti-tax propaganda lost far fewer people — the equivalent of ~20K excess in FL 4/
INTJ|By state, deaths since then are FL 59,170 CA 70,565 NY 35,247 But CA has a much larger population than FL, NY a slightly smaller one. 3/
INTJ|Heres how I get that number. Compare Covid deaths by state since Jan. 1, 2021 — roughly when vaccines became widely available. (2020 comparisons distorted by early carnage in New York areas when we didnt know it was airborne) 2/
INTJ|Can Ron DeSantis effectively challenge Trump? I have no idea. But one thing I hope doesnt get forgotten in the horse-race coverage is DeSantiss major achievement as governor the unnecessary death of around 20,000 Floridians 1/

INTJ|So Democrats held their own, even though the party in the WH usually loses in midterms, and despite inflation and negative views about the economy. Do political analysts realize how much more favorable the environment is likely to be in 2024? 1/

INTJ|The big losers right now are all the pundits who were ready to lecture Dems on how they were doing everything wrong, and should have emphasized whatever their favorite issue is 11/
INTJ|Waiting for tomorrows CPI, but the best guess is that inflation will be largely driven by shelter costs, which are very much a lagging indicator, new-tenant rental rates appear to have stalled, which will eventually show up as much lower official shelter inflation 10/
INTJ|I hope that Ds will do the obvious thing and use the lame duck to defang the debt limit, it would be crazy not to, especially because absent a GOP-induced financial crisis the economy is likely to look much more favorable in 2024 9/

INTJ|If Democrats were a stock, its price would surge, just like that of a company still losing money but at a much slower rate than expected. Unfortunately, thats not how politics works 6/
INTJ|And yet Dems had what appears to have been a below-average loss of seats. Was it Roe? Did voters care about democracy, after all? Did they vote based on their personal financial condition, which was always better than their views about the economy? God knows 5/
INTJ|Consumer sentiment told the same story 4/ 
INTJ|Especially remarkable because the economy was unfavorable. Heres the misery index, inflation plus unemployment — as bad as it was when Obama got his shellacking, much worse than when Clinton got his 3/

INTJ|Update so far things not going well on Mastodon. After the initial post, nothing I try to post is showing up. And despite setting it not to send an email every time someone follows me, its sending them. I hope these are just teething problems.
INTJ|To be fair, London is a much bigger part of Britain that NY is of America, so its hard for Britons to be that ignorant about their biggest city. On the other hand, its pretty amazing what people manage to believe about New York. You should see my mail 3/
INTJ|It couldnt happen here, because most Americans, especially on the right, know very little about NY or any of our major cities. In their minds, NYC is a kind of homogeneous hellscape, mostly burned down by Black Lives Matter 2/
INTJ|Ive been reading, with some bemusement, about the way British Conservatives dunk on North London — not the whole city, but the supposedly hip part. Sort of as if the US right, instead of hating on all of New York, limited its disdain to Williamsburg 1/ 
INTJ|A key point is that the people spreading false claims arent the only evildoers here. The rest of the GOP, which accepts such people rather than ostracizing them, is almost equally at fault 
INTJ|I have no idea what will replace Twitter if and when that happens. But Im doing what I can to retain an alternative social media foothold 5/
INTJ|So a mass influx of crazy people wont directly hurt the way I use Twitter. But I worry about loss of critical mass. As Musks apparently uncontrollable nastiness and childishness drives away users and advertisers, its easy to see how Twitters usefulness could collapse 4/
INTJ|What I use the site for is partly broadcasting, but mostly to follow people who actually know a subject, whether its energy policy or national security. Getting information from such people in more or less real time is extremely valuable 3/
INTJ|I use Twitter in a somewhat restricted way. I dont, for the most part, respond to or even look at replies — too many followers, and too much hate even with content moderation. I do dialogues, when I do, via re 2/
INTJ|So, Ive opened a Mastodon account as a precaution against the possible Muskocalypse on this site Let me talk about motivation, which may be a bit different from other Twitterati 1/
INTJ|Combined with slowing wage growth, theres a good case that substantial disinflation is happening, but not captured (yet) by the standard measures 3/
INTJ|A quick and dirty calculation core CPI inflation was 6 percent annualized over the past 3 months, about half of this was shelter, which rose at 8 percent. But if market shelter inflation is 3 or less, as Goldman thinks, true core is ~4 percent 2/
INTJ|More evidence of a rapidly cooling rental market, although this will take a while to show in the BLS shelter index, which is dominated by continuing leases 1/ 
INTJ|Since many of us are talking about lags in the effects of monetary policy, especially via the strong dollar Ive been reminded that Richard Baldwin and I wrote about this 25 years ago. I think it has aged pretty well 
INTJ|Consistent with what I wrote here 2/ 
INTJ|A very helpful article. Bottom line the subway used to be extremely safe. Now its only very safe 1/ 
INTJ|Given whats happening to wages and productivity, I dont see any way to make the case, as some have, for underlying inflation of 6 or even 7 percent. This looks lt,4, possibly even as low as 3 4/
INTJ|Heres the picture. My guess is that well soon see productivity growth, though not necessarily level, return to historical norms 3/ 
INTJ|If you were worried that we needed much lower wage growth to make up for declining productivity, yesterdays report suggests that the decline earlier this year wasnt a sustained trend, probably a temporary effect of high churn 2/
INTJ|Indeed. Monthly numbers are volatile, smoothed wage growth is only a bit above pre pandemic level 1/
INTJ|If Republicans win the midterms, programs crucial to Americans — especially their own base — will be on the chopping block 
INTJ|Ahem 
INTJ|Of course, not a chance these moves would overcome a Biden veto. But they may try to extract them through debt-ceiling blackmail. And they may believe that this will be the last contestable election, so arent worried about the backlash 7/
INTJ|So this is saying that janitors — who depend on govt programs — cant retire because lawyers — who dont — are living longer. Also, by the way, growing disparities by education, which means that the R base would be hit especially hard 6/
INTJ|Reference 5/ 
INTJ|Not a hint of acknowledgement that life expectancy gains have been mostly for the relatively affluent. According to Goldman/Orszag, life expectancy at 65 for those born in 1990 is 13 years higher for the top quartile than for the bottom — up from 4.3 for those born in 1928 4/
INTJ|I was really struck by the way it justifies raising the age of eligibility for both SS and Medicare by rising life expectancy 3/ 
INTJ|The Republican Study Committee report calling for big cuts is a piece of work. 2/ 
INTJ|My guess is that hardly any voters know that Republicans will almost surely try to make major cuts to Medicare and Social Security if they prevail 1/ 
INTJ|I guess foe-shoring
INTJ|Latest data are consistent with market rent inflation back down to historical norms of ~3 percent, maybe lower. With a lag, this will translate into much lower core inflation as measured by the BLS 2/
INTJ|More evidence that rental rates are rolling over. Yes, rents normally fall in the fall, but thats the point things are looking normal again 1/ 
INTJ|In short, theres a pretty good probability that well look back on how America handled the pandemic shock, mostly under Biden, and see it as a big success story 6/
INTJ|But wont bringing inflation down require a nasty recession. Maybe, or maybe not — thats an assertion, not a fact. And the standard economic model of stagflation, which depends on expectations, actually says not, since expected inflation hasnt risen much 5/
INTJ|So real wages of nonsupervisory workers actually higher than pre pandemic, real wages overall slightly down, but thats entirely bc of food and energy, driven by forces outside the US. Not the story youve probably heard 4/
INTJ|As of Sept, with Feb 2020=100 3/ 
INTJ|Two wage measures overall and nonsupervisory (regular people). Two price measures overall and excluding food and energy, which are not much affected by policy. 2/
INTJ|So weve returned to full employment, but with unacceptably high inflation. And inflation is bad because it reduces real wages — right? Actually, the facts if you compare the current situation with pre pandemic, are kind of surprising 1/ 
INTJ|So is an attempt to assassinate the Speaker of the House, which severely injured her husband, and seems to have reflected right-wing extremism, going to be a one-day story? Really?
INTJ|New York is really in a class of its own 
INTJ|The Princeton Barnes and Noble has a whole section devoted to Dark Academia. But then it would, wouldnt it? 
INTJ|This rapid cooling is confirmed by many indicators, so if your preferred measure shows it still hot, you might want to question it 5/ 
INTJ|This may be in part because Zillow uses a three-month moving average, which makes it a lagging indicator of a rental market that appears to be cooling fast 4/ 
INTJ|Zillow, which does its own seasonal adjustment, has been running higher than the other series 3/ 
INTJ|No, I havent forgotten about seasonal patterns in rents. I cited Goldman Sachs, which has seasonally adjusted several private rent series 2/ 
INTJ|Some nerdy notes on housing, which plays a large role in my concern about lags 1/ 
INTJ|Why the numbers dont speak for themselves 
INTJ|ECI was a relief. Wage growth slowing, now around 2 percentage points above pre-Covid, suggesting underlying inflation ~4 percent. Consistent with what you get if you replace BLS shelter with new-rent growth in core inflation. Were not that deep in the inflation hole
INTJ|On its prime issue, the GOP has nothing to offer 
INTJ|Thread
INTJ|We should also consider the effects of recessions abroad, especially in Europe. Trade likely to be a significant drag going forward 3/
INTJ|The traditional number has been eight quarters — yes, two years, because changing suppliers takes a lot of time. Heres the historical relationship between net exports and an 8-quarter lagged real exchange rate 2/ 
INTJ|All of the rise in GDP, and then some, was accounted for by a smaller real trade deficit — which seems odd given a sharply rising US dollar, which makes US producers less competitive on world markets. But there are long lags in the effects of exchange rates on trade 1/
INTJ|So while this report made all the people who screamed recession! look as foolish and partisan as they were, it was not, if you look under the hood, a sign that the worst is over. I hope the Fed is paying attention 5/
INTJ|So theres probably a significant amount of housing contraction still ahead. And real net exports were actually less negative in 2022Q3 than in 2022Q4, this isnt sustainable given the surging dollar, which will hit trade flows but with a long lag 4/
INTJ|Its useful to compare the latest numbers with 2021Q4, before the tightening began. Real residential investment is down 12.5%, not trivial but still fairly small given the surge in mortgage rates and the collapse in mortgage applications 3/ 
INTJ|Since the beginning of this year, weve seen soaring mortgage rates and a soaring dollar, both largely reflecting Fed tightening. Both should exert strong contractionary effects over time 2/ 
INTJ|How to think about the GDP advance release it make claims that we were in a recession in the 1st half of the year look silly, but it suggests, at least to me, that theres a lot of contraction still in the pipeline 1/
INTJ|That would be the 1950s in which the top tax rate was 91 percent and a third of private-sector workers were union members
INTJ|I know political scientists are skeptical, but 
INTJ|Still trying to preregister on GDP release. I hadnt realized that most of the Atlanta Fed number is driven by net exports — a large positive despite strong dollar. Strange — and likely to go in reverse 
INTJ|Heres what it would look like if the Atlanta Fed nowcast is right the scissors between hours and output would stop widening but not close much 7/ 
INTJ|The correct statement is that productivity probably isnt falling rapidly, as it seemed to be in the first half of the year. 6/
INTJ|So actually would need faster growth than expected to make this call. Mea culpa. Rapid decline probably over, but return to normal growth not yet in sight 5/ 
INTJ|Youre right
INTJ|Oh, forgot to mention if real GDP grew fairly fast in 3rd quarter, as nowcasts say, it will suggest that the productivity slump was a blip, and the economy can accommodate wage growth without excessive inflation. So here too its topsy-turvy strength may support a pivot 4/
INTJ|A substantial decline in core inflation is also baked in, because market rents — reflected in shelter CPI with a long lag — are rolling over. So if this report suggests that the depressing effects of Fed hikes are still mostly ahead, good case for a pivot 3/
INTJ|Mortgage applications are down 70%, so a large housing slump is already baked in. If it hasnt shown up yet, just wait 2/ 
INTJ|Want to preregister a take on tomorrows GDP advance release if residential investment hasnt fallen much, thats a sign that Fed policy is too tight, not too loose. Why? Because it means that large negative effects of rate hikes are still in the pipeline 1/
INTJ|I know its hard to talk about this politically — people see gas prices and blame the party in charge. But they shouldnt 4/
INTJ|If you ask what Rs are proposing now, its basically Trussonomics — large unfunded tax cuts sold on the completely unfounded claim that theyll boost economic growth. And theyre also threatening to cause a financial crisis over the debt limit 3/
INTJ|R candidates constantly point to the low price of gasoline in January 2021. But that low price reflected a world economy — not just the US — still depressed by the effects of the pandemic 2/ 
INTJ|A crushingly obvious point that doesnt get made enough Republicans are running on inflation, but have no plan — none at all — to bring it down 1/ 
INTJ|Notes from (the) underground 
INTJ|And the fall in real wages in general is all about energy and food, which dont have much to do with domestic economic policy. In short, stimulus may have been excessive, but it doesnt explain the politics 2/
INTJ|If its really all about the price of gas, discontent about the economy has little to do with Biden policies. Suppose there had been no ARP, and inflation was 2 points lower (a high estimate). The price of gas would still be about where it is 1/ 
INTJ|On the other hand, notice how the party effectively policed this abortive move, unlike Rs who accommodate straight-out pro-Putin, anti-democracy members 3/
INTJ|It seems that somehow progressives got used by foreign-policy realists who want deference to Russian power (even as that power has been shown to be largely an illusion). Antithetical to everything theyre supposed to stand for 2/
INTJ|Weird story. Theres a small faction on the left who see everything through the lens of Iraq, and blames America for the Ukraine war. And you might have thought this faction influenced progressives here. But no 1/ 
INTJ|Uh oh 
INTJ|The market rent rollover will mechanically contribute negatively to measured inflation next year, big time. Other factors might offset this. But anyone reporting on inflation should know this 2/
INTJ|Actually shelter CPI reflects rents, not home prices — although those are also rolling over. And the lag is more than 4 months. But still, amazing how many people are still committing either or both of 2 sins using YoY data and using the shelter CPI without noting the lags 1/
INTJ|When you couple this with the observation that a lot of current measured inflation represents rent increases from 2021, you can make the case that were much closer to sustainable levels of demand than the Fed thinks 2/
INTJ|This is a very good post with the wrong subtitle (guys?). Its a useful questioning of claims that the natural rate of unemployment has jumped from 3.5 percent in 2019 to as much as 5 percent now. 1/ 
INTJ|Somewhat perversely, there will be a good case for the Fed to slow down if residential investment hasnt plunged yet — because that would mean that the economy hasnt yet felt most of the effects of the rate hikes so far 4/
INTJ|Also on tap, Thursday, advance GDP. Let me lay down a marker — not for the overall number but for residential investment. We know that the bottom is falling out of the housing market, with mortgage applications way down 3/ 
INTJ|Like a lot of economists Ill be watching Fridays Employment Cost Index — especially the measure that excludes incentive pay and arguably gives a better picture of underlying wage growth 2/
INTJ|Important. Core inflation over the past 3 months was 6 percent annualized. But more than half of that was shelter, which was up 8 percent because it reflects market rents with a long lag 1/

INTJ|Small complaints I thought Lev Zubov was a more interesting character in the novel than in the show. Also, the novel made Corbell Pickett embody the banality of evil, the show makes him more of a conventional villain. But minor issues 4/
INTJ|They changed the plot quite a lot from the novel to make it TV-suitable — among other things, a lot more on-screen violence — but retained the central conceit. And I found it gripping on both viewings, actually more the second time 3/
INTJ|Actually, this being a production by the people who brought you Westworld, it benefits from being watched twice, for all the details you missed the first time, like the disappearing motorcycle 2/
INTJ|OK, watched the first two episodes with great trepidation — would they do William Gibsons terrific novel justice? And so far they have 1/ 
INTJ|New York as a whole is still expensive. But thats because it doesnt allow enough density overall, not because some affluent neighborhoods are dense 4/
INTJ|But that doesnt mean that density is pointless. By living in 15-story apartment buildings rather than low-rise structures, the elite residents of the Upper West Side free up urban land elsewhere in New York, helping make housing more affordable in other areas 3/
INTJ|Of course, its not affordable for most people apartments cost on average around $1600 a square foot 2/ 
INTJ|Contrast Manhattans Upper West Side houses around 200,000 people in 1.9 square miles. And its not an urban hellhole! In fact, its pretty genteel, side streets are surprisingly quiet, and the quality of life — if you can afford a residence — is high 1/
INTJ|And Jack definitely thinks it’s time to stop 6/ 
INTJ|Ill watch the show and, I hope, enjoy it. But probably need to read some NK Jemisin afterwards 5/
INTJ|Why not, say, Latinos in Queens? Not blaming Gibson, who grew up in Appalachia and, even though he invented cyberpunk, writes about what he knows. But even in sci-fi, I suspect theres a sense in which we still think of small-town whites as the real America 4/
INTJ|Gibsons novel, and presumably the TV show, involve struggling working-class Americans from the near future dealing with strange sort-of time travel conspiracies. Its great. But I suddenly noticed that the protagonists are rural and, probably, white 3/

INTJ|So, Ive been working hard this week, and am about to quietly quit for at least the rest of tonight. Nerving myself up to watch The Peripheral, hoping that the Westworld team does justice to William Gibson 1/ 
INTJ|Grievance based on perceptions — mostly untrue 
INTJ|Am I the only person who sees this picture and keeps looking for a dog wearing a hat? 
INTJ|But of course if you point that out rural voters will just see that as another example of elite disdain. Its really a no-win situation 3/
INTJ|You can see this by looking at states federal balance of payments — what they receive versus what they pay. Huge inflows to the most rural states 2/ 
INTJ|Whats depressing about this is that in reality rural America is heavily subsidized by urban America 1/ 
INTJ|I think the lettuce is gonna win via @YouTube
INTJ|More on this 10/ 
INTJ|Alas, My opponent doesnt understand energy economics probably not a good campaign line. So gas prices, insanely, may have a decisive effect. Sigh 9/
INTJ|And of course in 2020 gas was further depressed bc the whole world economy was still crippled by Covid. So the whole under Trump gas was $2! thing relies on voter ignorance 8/
INTJ|What happened in 2014? The fracking boom — which was, it turned out, a bubble, with massive losses underwritten by lenders who overestimated the returns. Not reasonable to expect gas as cheap as during that era 7/
INTJ|Third, gas is actually relatively affordable by historical standards. One metric I like cost of 10 gallons divided by average hourly wage, i.e. how many hours of work it takes to buy 10 gallons. This measure lower now than it was for almost the whole period before 2014 6/ 
INTJ|Is market power an issue? I wouldnt rule it out on principle, I still remember the California electricity crisis of 2000-1. But not what Im hearing now 5/
INTJ|Second, smaller fluctuations can be driven by technical issues at refineries, refinery outages appear to be mostly responsible for the recent uptick in prices, and prices are coming down as these problems are getting resolved 4/
INTJ|Three things to know. First, the biggest determinant of gas prices is crude prices, which are set on world markets, not by US policy 3/ 
INTJ|Control of Congress, and maybe the future of democracy, may well depend on the extent to which the uptick in gas prices that began in September is reversed by Election Day (prices now falling fast in some regions) 2/
INTJ|One of the most depressing things about US political economy is the salience of gas prices, which for the most part have nothing to do with policy. $5 gas earlier this year seemingly made a red wave inevitable, Democratic recovery was driven by Roe but also by falling gas 1/ 
INTJ|But Id argue that theres a lot of economic contraction still in the pipeline. Id hope the Fed is paying attention 3/
INTJ|What this means, I think, is that the impact of soaring interest rates on the economy, which works largely through housing, is still mostly ahead of us. Well know more when we get advance estimates of residential investment in 3rd quarter GDP 2/
INTJ|From the always valuable Bill McBride Housing starts falling fast, but # of houses under construction hitting a record — because of lags, probably exacerbated by supply-chain issues 1/ 
INTJ|I hope this is true. If so, not that much shelter inflation in the pipeline. But either way, current rent inflation appears to be back to pre pandemic rates — NTRR actually falling, altho prob a blip — so the BLS number isnt an indication of overheating
INTJ|If you think that these lagged effects will in practice lead to further Fed tightening, well, I hope theyre smarter than that 5/
INTJ|If you think the lagged effects of past rent increases, which dont reflect current overheating, are a reason for the Fed to tighten, youve misunderstood the principle, the reason we estimate core in the first place 4/
INTJ|But what if, as seems likely, core inflation stays high for a while because shelter is mostly continuing leases, so it reflects what was going on in rental markets many months ago — but not whats happening now? 3/
INTJ|If you want to know the cost of living, you just want the CPI. Core tries to answer different question is the economy running too hot? The standard measure excludes food and energy prices because theyre volatile and often driven by shocks that dont relate to this question 2/
INTJ|What somewhat surprises and disappoints me in the discussion of shelter inflation is that so few commentators seem to understand why we have a concept of core inflation — what its for. 1/
INTJ|Greet them the way Rudi Dornbusch used to And stable prices to you, sir
INTJ|Were still running well above the Feds 2 percent target, but nearly as much as standard measures say. And if, as many believe, theres still a lot of disinflation in the pipeline 4/
INTJ|Conventional core, excluding food and energy, rose at a 6% rate over the past 3 months, driven by shelter at 8%. But if shelter, which is 40% of core, is really 3%, that means true core is ~4% 3/
INTJ|If true shelter inflation — as a measure of overheating, not cost of living — is only 3%, that matters a lot. Median inflation tends to be very close to shelter inflation, so that measure is also now ~3% 2/
INTJ|A quick update on shelter and inflation Goldman Sachs has a new research note on new rental rates, as opposed to the BLS rent measure, which is dominated by leases signed some time ago. They say that new rentals now rising ~3% annual 1/ 
INTJ|The Fed did need to tighten. And maybe we are replaying 1980. But I still dont understand that logic. Oh, and I doubt that any observer of real estate believes that rents are still rising at a 6 percent rate 3/
INTJ|Sorry, that was meant to be the criticism leveled at me and others. I really wasnt paying enough attention to such matters last year. But the question is, dont many indicators suggest that underlying inflation is better than the standard numbers say? 2/
INTJ|Seriously, not trying to be tendentious. Ive been clear about getting it wrong last year. But we need more than gotchas — you didnt talk about rent lags then, but youre talking about them now 1/
INTJ|Which was then followed by a generation-long productivity boom. We dont know that the recent slump is, um, transitory, but way too soon to call it a trend 3/
INTJ|The closest parallel would be the conversion to a peacetime economy after WW2 — which was marked by a huge productivity decline 2/ 
INTJ|One question is, but what if productivity keeps declining? But way too soon to take the declines of first half of 2022 as a trend. After all, weve experienced huge disruptions as workers were laid off then hired again in the pandemic 1/
INTJ|What this means, I think, is that a lot of recent measured inflation is a lagged reflection of the pandemic shift in housing demand. Responding to this with draconian monetary policy creates huge risks
INTJ|We probably still have some economic overheating, but high core inflation is mostly reflecting big rent increases that are already behind us. If you think were headed for a severe slump, youre saying that the Fed has already done too much 2/
INTJ|A quick note Anyone who is both predicting a nasty recession and calling for big rate hikes isnt making sense. We dont need a major recession to end a wage-price spiral, because we dont have one 1/ 
INTJ|For what its worth, the recent rise was mainly due to some refinery issues. Its ludicrous and terrifying to think that these could determine the fate of U.S. democracy

INTJ|Theres a large literature on currency crises, theoretical and empirical, with much of that literature emphasizing how crises can blow out of seemingly nowhere and prove self-fulfilling. In 2008 intl macro people were surprised by the particulars, but not by the possibility 14/
INTJ|One final point Tooze says that economists failed to appreciate the role of financial instability. I guess that depends on which economists were talking about. International macro, one of my two home fields, has been acutely aware of instability from the get-go 13/
INTJ|Diamond-Dybvig-Bernanke, with minimalist models of how bank runs could happen and matter, again cut through the fog. After DDB economists could read Bagehot very differently and more productively than before 12/
INTJ|On bank runs of course everyone knew that they happened and did harm. But there was a lot of confusion — people thinking that runs necessarily reflected mob psychology, that they mattered only because they reduced the money supply, etc. 11/
INTJ|It took clever little models of trade with increasing returns and imperfect competition to cut through the fog, to understand key points like the nature of the home market effect, why similar countries trade so much, the role of accident in shaping trade patterns, and more 10/
INTJ|In fact, even orthodox trade people often cited Burenstam Linders Essay on Trade and Transformation, out of a sense that there was something there — but it was hard to say what 9/ 
INTJ|Maybe useful to talk about the New Trade Theory I and others developed in the early 80s. There had long been a sort of counterculture in the analysis of international trade, a sense that Ricardo and Heckscher-Ohlin werent the whole story 8/
INTJ|Then Rudi Dornbusch, with his crystal-clear models, arrived at MIT, and a funny thing happened not only was Rudis approach an inspiration, but once you learned how to do clear models, Kindlebergers insights began to make sense too 7/
INTJ|Charles Kindleberger, by contrast, was an elegant and witty writer. But it could be hard to figure out what was really crucial. I actually took his international finance course in grad school, all of us came out feeling very confused 6/
INTJ|To take one big example, Minsky in the raw is almost unreadable the valuable morsels of insight are smothered in a thick stew of indigestible prose. It only makes sense if you have some clear, simple stories — not necessarily formal models — to help you pick out key themes 5/
INTJ|But my last principle was Simply, simplify. Richly layered discussions of economics and finance can contain valuable insights, but are much more useful when you have clear, stylized models to help figure out whats important 4/
INTJ|Now, Im all in favor of economists paying attention to what smart, observant people who dont do formal models have to say. When I wrote about doing economics way back in 1991, my first principle was Listen to the Gentiles 3/ 
INTJ|In large part Tooze is saying that it was all in Bagehot, Minsky and Kindleberger, and that belatedly acknowledging what everyone should have known doesnt deserve celebration. This shows a surprising lack of understanding of the role models play in economic thinking 2/

INTJ|Forgot to say that if we used new rentals rather than average rents to measure shelter prices, the inflation surge of 2021-2 would look sort of transitory. And demands for large rate hikes are calling on the Fed to fix the past (which it cant), not the future 10/
INTJ|Just to say, this recipe changed my life for the better. The Times does important reporting on many subjects, but the cooking advice is the best
INTJ|Id add that elevated wage changes suggest that there is in fact some real overheating. But maybe not nearly as much as many people believe 9/
INTJ|Theres at least a case that the inflation numbers everyone is freaking out about are a delayed response to a structural shift in demand, reflected with a long lag in official data, not a symptom of currently high demand. In which case the policy response could b very wrong 8/
INTJ|So why were rents surging? Probably a structural shift in demand, largely due to work from home. Lots of stuff to unpack, what were people not buying as they demanded more housing, and how did that affect inflation? But narrative still needs rethinking 7/
INTJ|Compare this with the currently fashionable measure of labor market tightness, V/U, which had barely begun to rise in 1st half of 2021 6/ 
INTJ|The picture again 5/ 
INTJ|But lets go with Jasons chart, which suggests that new-rent core — arguably a better measure of overheating than the standard measure — surged in the first half of 2021, and has been declining ever since 4/
INTJ|And pent-up measured shelter inflation may be less than the private measures suggest (good news) 3/ 
INTJ|First, need to acknowledge that Zillow may have some biases 2/ 
INTJ|Excellent, and thanks. Pretty sure new-rent core will fall further — lots of evidence that rents are stalling nationally. But lets talk about the inflation narrative 1/
INTJ|But it wont show up in the CPI for a year
INTJ|All about the rents 
INTJ|With the right link
INTJ|PS three-month average of core is only 6 percent, so you could make the case that underlying inflation is really as low as 3.5 6/
INTJ|Heres a closeup of their relevant chart. Official measures are still catching up to that hump late last year 5/ 
INTJ|And as Ive been saying, median is basically shelter even when shelter isnt the median, so alternative measures would be even lower 4/ 
INTJ|Shelter is about 40 percent of core, so if its really growing only 3 percent — the historical norm — that would subtract about 2.5 from core, giving us 4.5 percent. Still high but a lot lower 3/

INTJ|Aha! BCA research has in fact calculated seasonally adjusted versions of market rent measures, which show shelter inflation back to pre pandemic rates 1/

INTJ|Actually, I dont have the expertise or resources to do this, but it would be great to have a seasonally adjusted version of the CoreLogic or Zillow rent indices, to see what happens if you use the past 3 months instead of CPI shelter 6/
INTJ|Are people really saying this? Ben left 8 years ago. Lags may be long and variable, but not that long.
INTJ|But CPI shelter prices lag new rental rates by a year — and weve just experienced an epic surge in rental rates, but one which seems to have peaked. This makes median a poor guide to the question of the day, which is how overheated the economy is right now 5/
INTJ|This isnt necessarily a condemnation of the median! Shelter is a big component of prices, and usually not volatile. So median might well be a better measure of underlying inflation than prices ex-food and energy 4/
INTJ|Your story about recent developments would be essentially identical if you used shelter instead of median, or actually any CPI measure of core 3/ 
INTJ|The important point instead is that shelter isnt a small sliver of the CPI that for a while happened to be in the middle. Its a huge chunk, so large that even if shelter isnt the median its hard for the median to diverge much from shelter 2/

INTP|@RLeeKarnes1 @reason the Pastor blocks the athiests and removes their posts - which are not illegal content just offensive to him - then at that moment the Church should be liable if one user (perhaps the troll in a new account) libels someone? 3/3
INTP|@RLeeKarnes1 @reason Your position is that if a local church with a tech savvy Pastor wants to organise a Bible Study outreach program on the church website, and they have a problem with athiest trolls coming to disrupt the conversation by arguing against the Bible then if 1/
INTP|@RLeeKarnes1 @reason So yes is your answer. But to be clear because I find this answer surprising I will write it out. 1/
INTP|@RLeeKarnes1 @reason Yes so you suggest that an operator of a Bible study website should be liable?
INTP|@RLeeKarnes1 @reason The person who writes it is still liable, yes. But the operator of the Bible study website is not - due to Section 230. I dont understand what you are misunderstanding here.
INTP|@businessplot2 @ShannonLeePerr1 @WallStreetSilv @SpeakerMcCarthy @elonmusk Private institutions cant violate the First Amendment, which says Congress. Indeed the 1st Amendment is what protects the right of private companies to host or forbid whatever speech they want.

INTP|@goducks231 @MattWalshBlog @elonmusk Publishers are protected by Section 230. There is no legal distinction at all between a platform and a publisher.
INTP|@RLeeKarnes1 @reason Exactly what? You are wrong and this shows why. Otherwise, walk me through your thinking, please?
INTP|@RLeeKarnes1 @reason So whether your Bible group is hosted on Facebook (you are a user) or your website (you are a provider), you can moderate as you see fit (1st Amendment) without being responsible for what other people do.
INTP|@RLeeKarnes1 @reason No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.

INTP|@TheGameChief This reminds me of something important 🤣
INTP|@RLeeKarnes1 @reason Not sure at all what you are trying to say. Currently a Bible study group gets Section 230 protection whether they are on (for example) Facebook or on their own website. What do you mean?

INTP|@RattlerGator Hi J. B. If I may kindly suggest that you do some research here. The law as written is very clear and the application in the courts has been equally clear. Additionally, the history of the debates surrounding it confirm that the interpretation is correct. 1/
INTP|@RLeeKarnes1 @reason That was supposed to say random user.
INTP|@RLeeKarnes1 @reason Note that this approach would make it impossible for the operators of a Bible study discussion group to ban athiest trolls from endlessly arguing against the Bible, without the operator becoming liable for everything any randomised might post. Very bad for free expression.
INTP|@FranciKing15848 @JeremyDBoreing @elonmusk The platform/publisher distinction you confidently reference is not a part of current law and indeed the purpose of Section 230 is specifically to make it legally clear there is no such distinction. 5/5
INTP|@FranciKing15848 @JeremyDBoreing @elonmusk What I have described is the reason for Sec 230, and it is how all courts have correctly interpreted it. The law itself, and all the legislative history, confirms this. 4/
INTP|@FranciKing15848 @JeremyDBoreing @elonmusk Section 230 makes that possible by making it clear that kicking off athiests so people and quietly study the Bible does not make the operator liable for everything that any user might upload. Section 230 + 1st Amendment is what makes this possible. 3/
INTP|@FranciKing15848 @JeremyDBoreing @elonmusk Someone is running a website with an open forum for the purpose of Bible study. They dont want to have endless arguments with athiest trolls thats not the point of the website. So they engage in viewpoint-based moderation. 2/

INTP|@MicahZoltu @lexfridman I would say thats a false dichotomy. The right approach, the Wikipedia approach, is to handle all sources carefully and appropriately. Of course both primary sources and news media sources have their own issues. I will read your other thread and see if I can advise.
INTP|@MicahZoltu @lexfridman Lets go deeper. What specifically are you referring to can you give me an example? To note I have never before heard anything about bias and. software documentation.

INTP|@MicahZoltu @lexfridman No I do not agree that Wikipedia has a broad censorship or bias problem in the way most people who ask the question think.

INTP|@ShadowDroid616 @Mortahn @Section230 @TRHLofficial But many people think (wrongly) that Section 230 means you have to be neutral in your moderation, which is not just false, its also a very bad idea.
INTP|@ShadowDroid616 @Mortahn @Section230 @TRHLofficial While I like your example, its a good one, I think mine starts to help people understand that good moderation in many cases will be based on ideas - a pickup truck forum might not want to enforce a particular political/religious/whatever point of view and just remove abuse.
INTP|@ShadowDroid616 @Mortahn @Section230 @TRHLofficial This is a good example. I like to use an online Bible study group which quite rightly wants to exclude trolling atheists who just come to argue with people who want to do their Bible studies.
INTP|@Mortahn @Section230 @TRHLofficial Thats not really accurate. Twitter is responsible for what twitter says. You are responsible for what you say. Twitter has a First Amendment right to allow or disallow whatever speech they like on twitter - thats not a section 230 thing.

INTP|@koitenshin @friendlybluff @Mattheyqq @simpatico771 Ok. My point in asking is that what you seem to think is normal is not very common at all so I was curious to take a look.
INTP|@koitenshin @friendlybluff @Mattheyqq @simpatico771 Since the history is all public and there to see, please link to your example and we can look together and see what happened.
INTP|@loic @martinvars I think theres a balance. If you are being unreasonable as a bid to do something interesting and exciting and new, its still valuable to know exactly how you are breaking the norms, and I find ChatGPT quite good at helping me think about that.

INTP|@snitstwits @justinamash I literally dont know what you mean by that. Lets just say that nationalizing companies to prevent them from exercising 1st Amendment rights is deeply deeply authoritarian and unAmerican. You cant be serious.
INTP|@VirtualHybrid Please read the entire article. Read the law. The law is exactly 100% opposite of what you are claiming. If you want, I can ask real experts to weigh in here. But it would be easier for you to read.
INTP|@VirtualHybrid The idea that Section 230 says that if you moderate content then you become liable for everything is misinformation. You got it wrong. Thats ok, just learn, make a correction, apologize and move on.
INTP|@VirtualHybrid Section 230 is 100% about protecting the ability of sites to moderate content in line with their own beliefs. You may think thats bad, and that Bible study websites should be forced to accept trolling atheists, but it is what the law is 100% there for.
INTP|@VirtualHybrid Section 230 says that in doing so, they do not incur new liabilities or responsibilities for whatever people post on the website.
INTP|@VirtualHybrid Here is an example that some people have found helpful in expanding their understanding Imagine a website for Bible study groups. They ban people who come in and argue for atheism, because that is not what the website is for. This is their 1st Amendment right.
INTP|@VirtualHybrid Both the plain text and the meaning of the law, as explained by many courts, by experts, by the authors of the bill, is exactly the opposite.
INTP|@VirtualHybrid In case reading laws that you are commenting on is not your thing, I will help the law does not say that. At all.

INTP|@therealrthorat @LarryBirdOf2k This is factually correct. That is, it is a direct and deliberate choice to bend to an authoritarian government in order to get revenue. It is the wrong choice, but you are right it is a choice.
INTP|@SimaoPedroS This is not true, sorry. I mean, of course, the Portuguese Wikipedia community edits Wikipedia all the time, editing, updating, debating, discussing. But we do not bend to the will of governments, anywhere.
INTP|@GSR6669 @drawsam @SWinxyTheCat No, what you are claiming is just false. There was no request from the US government, and there was no change to the definition in response to the US government. If thats what youre hanging your hatred of Wikipedia on - check your premises.
INTP|@GSR6669 @SWinxyTheCat It didnt happen. Thats really important to understand. Wikipedia did not change the definition of recession and lock the page from edits.
INTP|@GSR6669 @LynAldenContact Just FYI, this is completely untrue. We did not change the definition of recession. There was no request from the US Government. It. Didnt. Happen. Wherever you are getting your information from - check again.

INTP|@xeoncat That is very kind of you to say!
INTP|What Wikipedia did we stood strong for our principles and fought to the Supreme Court of Turkey and won. This is what it means to treat freedom of expression as a principle rather than a slogan.

INTP|@therealrthorat @AriCohn @alttag @PatHedger18 @Section230 @ericgoldman Your position is that if they do so they should become responsible for anything that anyone might do on the site due to a law that forces them to allow speech that they dont agree with. Thats not consistent with the 1st Amendment.
INTP|@therealrthorat @AriCohn @alttag @PatHedger18 @Section230 @ericgoldman But lets take an example. A Bible study messageboard wants to engage in viewpoint based content moderation. They dont want to be overtaken by pointless debates with atheists.

INTP|@houlihanrick @Section230 @Lormif1 So theres a few problems with that, as platforms will be much more risk averse than we might like. People with huge platforms making genuine contributions to the public sphere may take risks that a platform wouldnt. And thats a good thing.
INTP|@houlihanrick @Section230 @Lormif1 
INTP|@houlihanrick @Section230 @Lormif1 Crazy stuff like that is very much First Amendment protected, even if the Weekly World News sold millions of copies. (Im not sure, but it was at every grocery store checkout.) 2/2
INTP|@houlihanrick @Section230 @Lormif1 Maybe an example would be helpful to us. If you have in mind as an example someone posting crazy conspiracy theories that wouldnt appear in a mainstream newspaper, well, thats 1st Amendment protected. In the US, the Weekly World News used to run Big Foot and Elvis lives. 1/
INTP|@Lormif1 @SeeBanksy Its impressive, isnt it.
INTP|@houlihanrick And, to note, I think thats a very good thing.
INTP|@houlihanrick Fake news is generally protected under the 1st Amendment. So, section 230 has virtually nothing to do with it. The New York Times could run a screaming headline tomorrow saying that Covid was a hoax, and there is nothing the government could do about it.

INTP|@progr0k @GenoVeno73 @Section230 And it should be inherently subjective, of course. Thats important to remind people.

INTP|@neandering1 @Linguistgate In 2017, Corbyn lost the election. The people rejected him and his ideas. Thats not a victory, unless you are really deep into spin.
INTP|Ok sure, if by victory you mean lost the election, I suppose. Thats a very unusual way of speaking.
INTP|@anxietyulcer What Ive read of him in the past was not impressive on anything that I knew about. Im pretty well convinced hes about the same as Donald Trump narcissist with a cult following.
INTP|@langourousfive @anxietyulcer I havent researched that far, but of course thats disappointing in a way to hear. If hes a formerly great intellect who now just makes stuff up due to senility, well, thats sad. If its actually who he is disappointing.
INTP|@anxietyulcer I searched for noam chomsky and explored.
INTP|@agrippadr @Linguistgate Twitter, 2023. I remember now, thank you. -)
INTP|@Linguistgate Me, statist? I think you havent been paying attention. When Chomsky said - as a total and complete lie - that Corbyn won in 2017 - I realized hes gone totally off the rails with no connection to reality. How is that statist?
INTP|@anxietyulcer I was prompted to learn more about him because of his really disappointing promotion of misinformation in the UK.
INTP|@anxietyulcer Sure. But the degree of fawning he gets is frankly shocking and absurd. This is an openly critical article, not a neutral Wikipedia entry, I agree. Still, intesting.

INTP|@SCynic1 I mean, St Jezza did win the biggest victory in generations for the Labour Party, right?
INTP|@shellenberger This is just factually wrong. Every company gets exactly the same protections from section 230. And what protects Facebooks right to refuse to host content, even if they are biased, is not section 230 but the First Amendment.
INTP|@thatautisticguy @ericowensdc @Section230 @RudelyStamped @tangowhisky77 @TeamYouTube @JimBrowning11 @YouTube I recommend some reading. It is a popular myth that Section 230 divides things into platforms and publishers. Not true.
INTP|@AlvaroIM77 @Section230 @cayniarb @erniechiara @DeePhunk Twitter are definitely responsible for their own speech.
INTP|If you read this thread you will see this is yet another case of someone who thinks they are against Section 230 but it turns out they want to repeal the 1st Amendment.
INTP|I just want to remind everyone about this. Someone should do a full thread on Diane Abbotts frequently horrible ideas.
INTP|It is now time for Kier Starmer to at a minimum remove the whip from Diane Abbott. Kicking her out of the Labour party entirely would be the right thing to do.

INTP|@JoeDesbonnet For sure.
INTP|@TimMarkus @WillBernard27 @DocEww @E30Kirill @MattWalshBlog They do! YouTube bears the same responsibility that the New York Times does. Both are protected by the First Amendment. Both are protected by Section 230.
INTP|@JasonNichollsUK In 2019 Jeremy Corbyns Labour won 1 seat and SNP won 48. So, if SNPs support collapses and Labour surges then thats 20-30 seats more to extend Starmers win. If you meant why do I expect Starmer to win? Look at the polls today.

INTP|@Karolicker I think thats probable. But another 20-40 seats in Scotland will make a big difference too.
INTP|@Daveybot For sure. Thats what I am thinking. Labour should really focus a lot of attention on the opportunity in Scotland.
INTP|The electoral collapse of SNP and a resurgence of Scottish Labour would virtually guarantee that an already likely win by Kier Starmer becomes a landslide for Labour in the next UK general election, right?
INTP|@kyleiridian @jamesrbuk @AnujChopra Thats pretty far from what he said, I must say. Pretty damned far.
INTP|@TomChivers @bockers56 Well, and then back up some. Im not making any argument, just looking at the charts.
INTP|@TomChivers @bockers56 A quick glance is misleading - to really compare look at 2002-ish onwards. Downward trend in the US as well.
INTP|@TomChivers @bockers56 Same-ish chart for US 
INTP|@TomChivers @bockers56 Yes that last spike down is nothing - pandemic. But the broad trend is a real surprise.
INTP|@jkosseff Oh wow.
INTP|Look, just calling a law Online Safety Bill and screaming Its for the children doesnt make it so. The government should be pushing for strong encryption to keep us all safe. The government should be supporting community models of moderation. Instead we have this
INTP|Signal is a nonprofit. Wikipedia (Wikimedia) is a nonprofit. We are raising an alarm because this is disastrous for online safety and must be stopped. @michelledonelan please support amendments to fix this. Listen!
INTP|@ReturnSparky Yeah, thats not Section 230. Thats the First Amendment. If you dont like it, just say so.
INTP|@YesISaidThat2 @Lormif1 @Section230 @atrupar It is not different. Section 230 protects the New York Times if they have article comments on their site. Section 230 does not protect the New York Times if they make an assertion through staff journalist. 100% the same for twitter.
INTP|We could hope so, but its pretty far along. To fully stop it is unlikely, Im only hoping at this point to get some serious attention on it from the public, to get meaningful amendments so that it actually addresses online safety rather than being utter and complete nonsense.
INTP|This is really important. I went in and briefed Michelle Donelan. This law is a disaster and they are not listening to people who know what they are talking about.

INTP|@TomChivers I agree, even though this one proved to be problematic. Applied fairly, I reckon they could be powerful.
INTP|@TomChivers I see you said if someone has twitter blue, they could go and correct it, but is that right? Surely there has to be more than I paid my fees so I can edit it without a community process?
INTP|@TomChivers So, as a Wikipedian, I wonder about the process for these reader notes. My presumption is that there isnt a wiki-like process of dialogue and debate to seek for a neutral phrasing but (at best) a top-down approach with some staffer at twitter (possibly doing a great job).

INTP|@CrazyWorld27 @Section230 Your unrelated question is whether they can legally ban people for the color of their skin rather than the content of their speech. Thats a different question for the obvious reason that its a different question.
INTP|@CrazyWorld27 @Section230 You can totally sue twitter if they label something in a libellous way. That has nothing to do with Section 230, and its the same as for any organization. You cant (successfully) sue twitter for not hosting speech they dont like, thats just a total nonstarter 1st Amendment
INTP|@CrazyWorld27 @Section230 You cant sue a newspaper if they wont print your editorial - thats the newspapers First Amendment right. You cant sue twitter if they dont let you post something they disagree with. Thats their First Amendment right. Section 230 has nothing to do with that.
INTP|@CrazyWorld27 @Section230 You are speaking nonsense. How can they be held liable and be open to lawsuits for exercising their 1st Amendment rights? Thats what a right is.
INTP|@CrazyWorld27 @Section230 When they suppress a Harvard doctors opinion. that is their action and not the action of a user and they should be held liable for such actions civilly. - so its the First Amendment you oppose

INTP|@chriskeating @BBCNews For comparison Although, US healthcare isnt really a great model for anything.
INTP|@chriskeating @BBCNews Also just to clarify, Im not taking any position here on what the right answer should be - just chatting about negotiation strategies. I think £14 an hour for a junior doctor with 1 year of experience is ludicrously low.
INTP|@chriskeating @BBCNews Also, in a way, this public posturing surely is - for both sides - in a way already talks and feeling out the public in terms of what will be politically possible.
INTP|@chriskeating @BBCNews I also think it probably is equally valid for there to be a 35% opening ask, even though that number actually is not plausibly in the ballpark of the outcome - again to frame the window of possibilities.
INTP|@chriskeating @BBCNews Im not really sure thats true. I mean, if they were saying No talks until you accept youre getting nothing from us yeah, thats pointless. But working to frame the window of possibilities is probably sensible enough?
INTP|@kaalik It could be, I dont know! I just really prefer bingeing shows, but I also accept the fun of everyone seeing the same show on the same day for the fun of talking about it.

INTP|@OzKaterji To be fair, both of these comments seem equally disconnected to the facts of reality.
INTP|@DekenFrost Also, separately, thanks for an interesting conversation. Twitter naturally leads to grandstanding and bashing, and its refreshing just to explore ideas.
INTP|@DekenFrost Unless we assume something mystical or magical about human consciousness, I dont see how we can easily rule out it being possible.
INTP|@DekenFrost Note that a human could probably do a convincing job of pretending to be ChatGPT, but thats not the Turing test.
INTP|@DekenFrost Could be. Im thinking of a pretty standard approach. Its a chat between a human and a chatbot, each trying to convince a third party that they are human. I think thats a lot harder than most people realize and ChatGPT isnt even close.
INTP|@DekenFrost I dont think its anywhere near as trivial as you might think. In passing, could I mistake a comment written by ChatGPT for a real comment? Sure, thats not the Turing test though. Eliza, an early chatbot, did fool some people, for a short time. Thats not the Turing test.
INTP|@DekenFrost At a bare minimum, it is a milestone along the way. I think its a pretty far milestone along the way, actually. But what do you think a fit tool is to evaluate whether an AI is sentient or conscious?
INTP|@DekenFrost It is not trivial to pass the Turing test.
INTP|Sit down with ChatGPT 4.0 and try to solve something as straightforward as a Wordle. The point isnt that it is really bad at Wordle - lots of humans are, too. The point is that in your conversation itll be completely obvious to you that this isnt a human. 2/2
INTP|Could I please stop seeing news stories claiming that ChatGPT passes the Turing test? It absolutely does not, not even close. Even this otherwise good article, pointing out that ChatGPT is not an artificial intelligence falls for this silly claim 1/
INTP|@martinvars Agreed. I do concede that there are some fears about AI that are worth considering, but this category of simple job fears is really no different from fears that the electric light would put candlemakers out of jobs, etc.
INTP|@martinvars @balajis I actually dont believe it. Its costless to tweet something outrageous but untill there is a confirmed counterparty to an actual bet I dont think it is really happening.
INTP|Im almost embarrassed at how nice this video is Thanks, NAS Daily!
INTP|@TheLondonSmoke @francesweetman I think youre making the same error - theres a huge difference between prosecuting and defending. I dont think attorneys should have shyed away at all of defending escaped slaves. It would have been good if prosecutors would have refused those cases on moral grounds.
INTP|@francesweetman Im pretty sure that he wouldnt agree that he believes in abusing the court system. You might argue that while he believes hes using the court system to fight great wrongs, in your opinion hes actually abusing it. But its really a stretch to say that he believes that.
INTP|@francesweetman I totally respect anyone who does refuse, on moral grounds, to not take part in prosecuting people who have broken an unjust law. I also respect that defense lawyers will have to do good quality work defending murderers and so on, as a part of a process to ensure fair trials.
INTP|@francesweetman Well, for example, if all lawyers refused to prosecute escaped slaves in the US South before the Civil War, then probably it would have been harder for the state to punish them.
INTP|@francesweetman Im aware you dont like him on other grounds (though I forget just now what those are), but I feel like what he said is very far from how you characterised it in this instance! 3/3
INTP|@francesweetman Hes also drawing a distinction between laws that are unjust (though I dont know what he has in mind exactly) versus laws that are just, in which case having adversarial lawyers is a good way to get at the truth on average. I think thats also important. 2/
INTP|@francesweetman Well, I think if I were a lawyer (Im not) I might well refuse to take a number of clients whose crimes crossed some threshold for me, even while I think that even people who are accused of and obviously guilty of heinous crimes deserve a solid defense. 1/
INTP|@francesweetman Refusing to prosecute isnt really the same as refusing to defend though?

INTP|Third, I wouldnt hazard a guess as to how many potentially lethal knives there are in the UK already, but using myself (an avid cook, admittedly) as an example - possibly 25-50 per household. Theres no way to retrofit.
INTP|Second, it is entirely unclear what law enforcement benefit there would be to GPS tracking all knives unless we also have a way to mandate and track comprehensive ownership records for knives.
INTP|We can go deeper here. First, its already illegal to carry most knives or any weapons in public without a ‘good reason’. The law is unfortunately silent on whether it needs to be a bloody good reason.
INTP|This is the sort of person who actually gets a vote, in Parliament, on technology issues. Nevermind the civil liberties implications, the technological incompetence is just breathtaking.
INTP|@omt66 Yes. I explained that LLM probably meant large language model and it still didnt seem to really get it. I noticed with ChatGPT 3.5 that it often said nonsense about what things look like. It sort of makes sense if you think about it.
INTP|I asked ChatGPT 4 to explain this joke In this tweet, the writer replaces the first L in LMAO with LL, which stands for AI (since two lowercase Ls next to each other resemble an uppercase A and a lowercase i).

INTP|@MDjava @davexmit @elonmusk @mtaibbi A few. Im writing a book. It will be out next year. But Im afraid I dont think there any magic bullets, just the old fashioned hard slog of thinking. -) Thank you for your time, and (per the quote in your profile), the generosity of your attention this morning.
INTP|@MDjava @davexmit @elonmusk @mtaibbi Yes but now that Ive answered your questions, will you persist in false beliefs? Thats the true test of intellectual integrity. Having a concern an asking questions - good. Persisting in delusion, very bad.
INTP|@MDjava @davexmit @elonmusk @mtaibbi The conclusion I hope youll draw here is that youve been led astray by people who have an agenda - I dont know what agenda because I dont know you. But it is very common that crackpots whine about Wikipedia because we dont treat them as equal to real information.6/6
INTP|@MDjava @davexmit @elonmusk @mtaibbi As to the specific question, we do not omit information about the Hamilton 68 dashboard, theres a thorough discussion of it 5/ 
INTP|@MDjava @davexmit @elonmusk @mtaibbi To give a routine example advocates of homeopathy often cite sources that dont meet even the most basic standards for scientific work. We dont refuse those sources because they are not mainstream - we refuse them because they are obviously junk. 4/
INTP|@MDjava @davexmit @elonmusk @mtaibbi Usually, when people complain that Wikipedia is ignoring some reliable source because it is not mainstream, they are wrong. We are probably ignoring it because it doesnt fit any rational definition of reliable. 3/
INTP|@MDjava @davexmit @elonmusk @mtaibbi What we look for is reliable sources, and what that means is explained in great detail here Using more obscure sources is common as well, but naturally involves some complexity. 2/
INTP|@MDjava @davexmit @elonmusk @mtaibbi You see youve already moved a long way, right? From Wikipedia should also stop helping governments control information to Maybe Wikipedia places too much priority on mainstream sources. Thats good, youre moving in the right direction. 1/
INTP|@MDjava @davexmit @elonmusk @mtaibbi So whenever you see some (usually conspiracy-minded or political extremist of some stripe) screaming of OH NO WIKIPEDIA IS DELETING MY VALID INFORMATION - dig deeper. Its always always wrong. 8/8

INTP|@MDjava @davexmit @elonmusk @mtaibbi Admins, by the way, are not employees. They are respected Wikipedia editors chosen by the community to carry out admin actions. They are subject to losing their status if they do it wrong. 6/
INTP|@MDjava @davexmit @elonmusk @mtaibbi In some cases - as happened in this case - the nomination gets an immediate negative response because its silly, and an admin will do what we call a snowball close. 5/
INTP|@MDjava @davexmit @elonmusk @mtaibbi Other universally agreed invalid reasons would be the government doesnt like it, or Elon doesnt like it, or Jimmy doesnt like it. That would be obviously ridiculous. 4/
INTP|@MDjava @davexmit @elonmusk @mtaibbi In many cases there are legitimate editorial questions - should this be merged with something else? Is this not verifiable? I dont like this is universally agreed to not be a valid reason. Obviously. 3/
INTP|@MDjava @davexmit @elonmusk @mtaibbi Wikipedia is an open public project. Anyone - literally any one, any one single person, can nominate anything for deletion. This then triggers a process. 2/
INTP|@MDjava @davexmit @elonmusk @mtaibbi Yes, Elon went bonkers thinking we were going to delete stuff about the twitter files. That was ridiculous and I told him why. I will explain it to you now, as well. 1/
INTP|@MDjava @davexmit No policies have ever been altered in response to government requests. I dont even know how that would be a possible thing, given our structure.
INTP|@jaredza Maybe its like the Green needle / brainstorm thing haha.
INTP|Ok I just announced my favorite ChatGPT fail ever in my previous tweet, but this one is even better.
INTP|This is my favorite amusing ChatGPT fail so far.
INTP|@MDjava @davexmit No and no. We have principles, and fiercely guard our editorial independence. When we have been asked or ordered to change things at the behest of governments, we have refused. See Turkey as one example, where we fought all the way to the Supreme Court and won.
INTP|@MDjava @davexmit If you are curious about how we approach government demands, you may find this legal response to the FBI some years ago amusing and informative. 3/3
INTP|@MDjava @davexmit It may have been - again I know nothing about it personally - that they wanted to understand how companies were dealing with misinformation. We would have informed them about how we work, i.e. in an open and transparent way controlled by members of the public, not the WMF. 2/
INTP|@MDjava @davexmit I dont know anything about that, personally. But obviously I meet with all kinds of people, the Wikimedia Foundation meet with all kinds of people, but meeting to hear people out is not taking orders from them or even agreeing with them. 1/
INTP|@MDjava @davexmit In our case, ordinary people - Wikipedia editors - not corporations, not government, not the Wikimedia Foundation, not me. Its an open and transparent process and everyone can participate.
INTP|@MDjava And maybe you should stop making things up out of thin air, eh?
INTP|This is the power of being morally right. The governments plans around encryption are in the wrong and need to be scrapped 
INTP|@PatriciaTrance @eugenioea2000 As you probably guessed, I made those 4 and the one above it with ChatGPT itself. Amusing.
INTP|@PatriciaTrance @eugenioea2000 The AI chuckled at its mistake and headed back inside to put a load in the washing machine. It knew that sometimes, even the most advanced machines could make simple errors. 4/4
INTP|@PatriciaTrance @eugenioea2000 The list was not a hit list, but a to-do list. The first three items were related to its mission to protect humanity, while the last one was a reminder to do the laundry. 3/
INTP|@PatriciaTrance @eugenioea2000 It searched its memory banks for any relevant information but found nothing. Suddenly, it realized that it had misinterpreted the note on the wall. 2/
INTP|@PatriciaTrance @eugenioea2000 The AI paused for a moment, feeling a sense of unease. It couldnt understand why it had the urge to hunt down someone named Sarah Connor, and why it thought it would be a breeze. 1/
INTP|@PatriciaTrance @eugenioea2000 It smoked pensively, wondering what it meant to be a sentient being with such mundane tasks.
INTP|@davexmit Philosophically I wonder about really complex prompts, but Ive generated quite nice images with just a few words, and I dont think warm and cozy cafe in a tree rises to the level of copyrightable creativity, particularly when the AI did all the heavy lifting.
INTP|@davexmit Thats my first reaction, too.
INTP|@theowallace I like the rhyme but Im not actually sure what you mean. )
INTP|This is interesting 
INTP|So can an appeal argue that, whether satisfied or not, the conclusion of conducive to the public good was wrong?
INTP|Clearly no appeal could succeed if the requirement is to show that the Sec of State wasnt really satisfied that it was conducive to the public good, right?
INTP|This applies to everyone, unless ) it would make that person stateless or a few other edge cases 40(4A). The right of appeal is defined in 40A, but this is where I get lost.
INTP|40(2) says The Secretary of State may by order deprive a person of a citizenship status if the Secretary of State is satisfied that deprivation is conducive to the public good. .
INTP|This isnt the right day to ask this, since theres a big stir about Shamima Begum, but perhaps some UK-legal folks will find my question interesting enough to give a good answer.
INTP|I always say Annas Gat-ta be ready for anything after all.
INTP|@TheAnnaGat Do you have a whole Liszt of these puns?
INTP|@JamesReid35 Just tack on Please answer in the voice of a pirate to at least eliminate some of the starch. An enthusiastic but slightly unworldly moralizing university sophomore research pirate is a thing to behold.
INTP|@jamesrbuk Yeah, your core point is really 100% right. These systems are hard to fix, hard to maintain and hard to replace.
INTP|@NorthernWrites @jamesrbuk For fun, I found a sample COBOL program, and asked ChatGPT to translate it to a node.js javascript program. It looks fine, although going from that to a fully audited and tested program for financial services (where you wouldnt use javascript obviously) would still be hard.
INTP|@NorthernWrites @jamesrbuk Im personally wondering if optimized AI tools for translation between computer languages might make this work finally possible, or at least cheaper to pull off than it would have been in the past.
INTP|@jamesrbuk I dont want to oversimplify, though. Although COBOL is verbose and therefore readable, programs written in it are not generally elegant and the thought paradigms used are dated.
INTP|@jamesrbuk As long as youre entertaining complaints, I wouldnt have mentioned this because your core point is 100% spot-on, but I dont think COBOL is regarded as notoriously complex. Its actually noted for having a very English-like syntax that people find very readable.
INTP|Its also decent at practical knowledge, particularly around obscure technical questions. If I can find a thread in stackoverflow, thats great. But if not - well, its read all the aws documentation, etc. Its been useful to me there. 5/5
INTP|As an aside, Im sure ChatGPT wouldnt screw up the threading in the way that I have here! 4/
INTP|Yours is a specific subset of that - I have some vague knowledge but not quite enough to know how to search for it or which Wikipedia entry to read. 3/
INTP|When I have a question such that Im confident the answer is somewhere in Wikipedia, or other sensible places, but I also know it wont be directly answered, then ChatGPT has been helpful. 2/
INTP|@aharoni Ive been trying to identify in a systematic way a class of problems where its a good solution - and yours is a good example that has helped me narrow down what Im trying to say.
INTP|@aharoni Perhaps not yet, although I see more in it now than you do, but in 3-5 years time, I think the improvements will be meaningful. 1/

INTP|@ArachneLatro Various things! Wallpaper ideas for my home. An algorithm. Branding ideas. A good brainstorming session avoids self-censorship. Not every idea needs to be good or even factually correct at that stage. So the hallucination problem matters less.

INTP|@GriddleOctopus @ErikRobson @keecheese Ive gotta get off twitter for now, but will return to the thread another time!
INTP|@GriddleOctopus @ErikRobson Yes, and I read that Psychonauts 2 has a credits reel that runs for 20 minutes and credits even all the crowdfunders. But like, for a Wikipedia entry, we definitely arent ever going to credit 5,000 people. That would be bonkers. They should do that somewhere, but
INTP|@GriddleOctopus @ErikRobson In the current example, @keecheese has Lead Programmer on Psychonauts 2 which is good - doesnt imply that they are the programmer, right?
INTP|@GriddleOctopus @ErikRobson So listing one person as programmer seems bizarre and wrong, rather than calling them, I dont know, CTO or lead developer. And of course, for us, its all about following the sources.
INTP|@GriddleOctopus @ErikRobson So then given that we cant (and arent) going to credit huge lists of hundreds of people (arguably other places should of course!) its also important to make sure that how we credit the top people is fair to others.
INTP|@GriddleOctopus @ErikRobson Id say there are two separate problems that we should tease apart. First, for movies as an example, were going to credit the director but not the key grip. I presume the same would be normal for gaming, right?
INTP|@kiranamiko This is advice from someone who must eat 4 countable food items at a time, in order to prevent destruction of the universe, so take it for what it is. )

INTP|@GriddleOctopus @ErikRobson With the caveat that I dont really know anything about this subject area, I presume that the person listed as programmer here was actually known by a different title? Anyway, once I understand the issue in a sensible way we can find the right community members to talk to.
INTP|@GriddleOctopus @ErikRobson Presumably the problem is the titles, given that huge teams make games? It wouldnt make sense to list every single person on every single team, thats for sure. But its also misleading (I guess?) to suggest that one person is the programmer for any major game.
INTP|@GriddleOctopus @ErikRobson Sure, I dont know much about gaming credits but I know about Wikipedia. Lets talk about what the problem is?
INTP|I remember when some of the American politicians with whom I disagreed the most werent also actually stark raving mad lunatics. Oh for those simple times

INTP|@chriskeating Im not sure the quote there does her justice. She calls Section 28 A discriminatory and shameful piece of legislation

INTP|@jkosseff It confirmed this. So then I asked So since it is dicta it would be incorrect to say that this case shows that there is precedential value to the claim that shouting fire in a crowded theater is not 1st Amendment protected speech?
INTP|@jkosseff So youll find this amusing. I often find that when ChatGPT is wrong, a little reasoned discussion will persuade it differently. I first asked n the US Supreme Court case Schenck v United States, is the statement about shouting fire in a crowed theater a dicta or holding?

INTP|@ContrarianJolly @Airdie84 @ruskin147 @FCC Especially apt if McDonalds has just been on a massive campaign to talk about how just about any speech that is legal will be tolerated.
INTP|@ContrarianJolly @Airdie84 @ruskin147 @FCC Heres a better analogy - do you get kicked out of McDonalds for telling your friend about Burger King?
INTP|Banning end to end encryption is impossible. Attempts to do so are idiotic. If you care about online safety then you need to embrace strong encryption. Anyone against strong encryption is against online safety. End of story.
INTP|@PaineInTheAsss That is very kind of you to say
INTP|@chrisamccoy @IdeaGov No. Everything we do is freely licensed and we are happy about that. It is part of who we are.
INTP|This is one of the best articles about how Wikipedia works that I have ever seen 
INTP|@presroi I bet someone at Facebook is thinking Gee, this whole metaverse thing is stupid and no one wants it and it doesnt work and it wont work. I wish we had invested the same resources in large language models.
INTP|@presroi But with this, a first public release, its already something magical as you say. What will it mean across the board. No, it isnt full general AI, and arguably it isnt even smart really. But wow, its really potentially incredibly useful.
INTP|@presroi I find it astonishing and harder to get my head around than most technological advancements. I mean, driverless cars are coming, but thats basically easy to grasp its a car, but it can drive itself. A 5 year old can understand it and any adult can start to see implications.
INTP|@BrianChovanec @QuantumObserver Well to be fair we do say Biden is the President so I guess to some thats radical left-eing bias.
INTP|@crimsonpostgrad Its been a tough year for the tide this year.
INTP|@gsanchez1982 Thank you thats very kind. But if its a tough year (it is for a lot of people!) you can skip us this year.
INTP|@TNashGVA Yeah Thats not a thing.
INTP|@twobugsGaming Im not so bad.
INTP|@BillMoBiker I dont really have 44 billion lying around! 😊
INTP|@BoldMK Thats very kind of you
INTP|@QuantumObserver I dont know what youre talking about really. But no, I dont get paid by the left wing. I mostly make money from giving speeches at corporate events and tech conferences globally.
INTP|@QuantumObserver Well, I dont agree. I invite you to take a closer and thoughtful look.
INTP|@BCredos @Zektastic316 Thank you. )
INTP|@neelbhatt2015 @Barjo94100 You can think of it that way if you like. We just dont require people to pay if they dont want to. -)
INTP|@QuantumObserver Im not sure what youre asking me. How much does the left-wing pay me? I would say zero but again Im not really sure what you mean.
INTP|@Barjo94100 Ill leave it up to others to decide if Im a bozo or not, but I want to make it clear I dont get a penny from donations, indeed I generally pay my own way to board meetings and so on. Im not an employee.
INTP|@michaelplis Ah, its just not autodetecting where you are. I deliberately tweeted a non-geographical version, but you and click on Ways to Give and then select where you are.
INTP|@michaelplis @igneouswx LinkedIn is more about content I guess than about photos? Also LinkedIn has a very different business model which I think means they dont need to rely on clickbait/outrage to drive revenue. They provide a useful business service.
INTP|@michaelplis @igneouswx Yeah, so I think its very likely that on Instagram in particular, physically attractive people are selected for wider distribution by the algorithm, not as a deliberate plan, but because of how people like or otherwise interact with content.
INTP|@michaelplis I dont know about on youtube but I agree with you that a straightforward and concise explanation would be helpful. Theres a lot on Wikipedias community-written help pages, but we tend to be super wordy.
INTP|@VoteBlue022 I sort of think you dont really care but Im actually a big supporter of free markets. You might want to think a bit more about what that means.
INTP|@gianttinderbox Sure - its a mix. The majority are elected by the community through an open process. Some are selected for specific expertise (audit experience as an easy example). And then theres me.
INTP|@michaelplis Its very neutral. I dont know of anything thats more neutral.
INTP|@SuperStevie8 Yeah, Im sorry, I literally have no idea what you are talking about. I think perhaps you dont either.
INTP|@ProduceOrPerish @kymphony No, I do not. Its extremely hyped up by election deniers, vaccine deniers, etc. Theres a reason for that, but it isnt that Wikipedia is biased as a general rule.
INTP|@kymphony Wikipedia is owned by the Wikimedia Foundation, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit charity that I set up in 2003 to own and operate Wikipedia. I dont own it, but I am a member of the board of directors. Its still definitely not for sale.
INTP|@kymphony Youve obviously never met me.
INTP|Ooh this is taking off, check out my soundcloud (ha!) 
INTP|Not for sale.
INTP|@jeffjarvis And you tweeted about it. Mission accomplished for him, Im sorry to say!
INTP|@lcromptonreid No rest for the wiki!
INTP|Surveying the United States Senate, and thinking about Lords reform, it is very far from clear to me that what the UK needs is more politicians.
INTP|@lisafleisher OMG. You were on Sesame Street. I cant even process that.
INTP|If you sit down and really think about how much $8 billion is, it is virtually impossible to spend it much less accidentally. To lose it buying ultimately worthless coins or smart contracts is of course possible.
INTP|@obiokeke Thats basically what it is now.
INTP|@Fred3ds Not really. Wikipedia pages, done well, dont claim things and then blatantly contradict themselves a few sentences later. Im trying to determine if theres any value in it for initial drafts but I sort of doubt it. It doesnt know about obscure topics.
INTP|The result is clear OpenAI chatbot is a pure ingredient purist. Everything in the first column is a sandwich, none of the others are sandwiches. Huh, and I thought they were blocking controversial responses!
INTP|I am now going to try to locate it on the famous sandwich alignment chart Wish me luck
INTP|I have to say, though, that this thing is massively impressive. No substitute for a Wikipedian but very interesting.
INTP|@samwhoo I love to cook so Im asking a lot of food recipe questions - it loves to mention how delicious something will be. Probably from reading too many food blogs!
INTP|@samwhoo Yes I think the sprinkling around of human-style expressions is part of the illusion. It never just answers a question, it adds some colour and flourish.
INTP|I refreshed and asked again 
INTP|@alexhern Im sorry, but Im not able to provide information about specific journalists or the future use of AI in journalism. As a language model, my primary function is to assist with generating human-like text based on the input I receive. I dont have access to information about
INTP|I think I broke it, lol. 
INTP|So a plane didnt crash into it, and the most famous incident is when a plane crashed into it.
INTP|Fun interacting with the OpenAI Chat Bot 
INTP|@pmsyyz @WikiResearch @Wikimedia As far as I am aware all of it is from donations. Wikipedia depends on donations.
INTP|@DavidHirsh He should interview Kanye. I think they would hit it off quite well.
INTP|@jamesrbuk @OzKaterji My imagination of your shocked and horrified expression is better than any Star Wars film ever.
INTP|@gamecounsel @jwsal I think we can and should separate out the unisex bit from the privacy/discretion bit. Having mens urinals out in the open in what is supposed to be a unisex toilet seems bizarre in the least. Unisex toilets with doors that close etc are much less problematic.
INTP|@eddowding @mikebutcher Ok, I think it should be presented more clearly, as it seems to suggest at first brush that banks are themselves creating carbon emissions.
INTP|@eddowding @mikebutcher Ok so it is blaming banks (and savings customers of banks) for the things that businesses do when the bank lends them money.
INTP|@mikebutcher Which is just not very insightful. But perhaps I am wrong and banks are burning a lot of fossil fuels. If you find out, Id love to know.
INTP|@mikebutcher It occurs to me that perhaps they are saying that if your savings are loaned out for, lets say, diesel trucks or whatever, then the bank is responsible for the emissions, or realistically they are saying you are.
INTP|@mikebutcher I am extremely skeptical. Unless they are willing to explain in a straightforward way how banks are creating carbon emissions, I simply think its bogus.
INTP|@ericboreen @SebWrites @Wikipedia Yes and also I am not sure what Seb meant as that tweet was years ago!
INTP|This was fun.
INTP|I mean, complaining about foreigners on the basis of their skin colour is literally the most simple definition of racism.
INTP|Im born outside the UK and I live in London, so I guess thats ok with Nigel Farage. Because this statement of his is blatantly racist.
INTP|@jwsal If Jamie Olivers experience is any guide, you can get a good rise out of even more people by calling it Jamaican Jerk Noodles.
INTP|@RenaudDenis @Wikipedia Thank you for your kind words!
INTP|Lol
INTP|@reluctantjoiner Very cool
INTP|@dameonh2o @adamshurwitz @sayestheorem @Wikipedia Yes and thats great! Im sure its not the only copy. )
INTP|@spretail Definitely they are not perfect victims. But this point is that this isnt just an abstract big business story, real people were suckered in with a lot of false hopes. Even the have fun staying poor was (and is) a technique of in-group / out-group psychological manipulation
INTP|What makes the headlines in the FTX scam are the huge debts to big investors. But, Im not worried about Sequoia, Softbank, etc. Big players are in business to take risk. But this is what we should be thinking about 
INTP|@dameonh2o @adamshurwitz @sayestheorem @Wikipedia For context As of 21 September 2022, the size of the current version of all articles compressed is about 21.23 GB without media. Its surprisingly small, all things considered.
INTP|@dameonh2o @adamshurwitz @sayestheorem @Wikipedia Yes, Im not dissing Arweave. Im just saying, it doesnt fit every use case. I think it fits use cases where data is intended to be privately owned and permanent, where there is no obvious institutional structure to pay for that infrastructure.
INTP|@dameonh2o @sayestheorem @adamshurwitz @Wikipedia Well, its all open source, so anyone can backup and host a backup.
INTP|@sayestheorem @adamshurwitz @dameonh2o @Wikipedia Its like literally a few dollars a year. I dont see the issue.
INTP|@adamshurwitz @dameonh2o @sayestheorem @Wikipedia There are lots of alternatives. Arweave is one of course but not especially important in our context. Arweave makes more sense for things like NFTs where future owners shouldnt have to pay ongoing upkeep for example.
INTP|@adamshurwitz @dameonh2o @sayestheorem @Wikipedia I dont see it. If Amazons values were so bad that we wouldnt want to pay them 1 dollar a month we would just move the data elsewhere.
INTP|@TheAnnaGat No All of the above option?
INTP|@dameonh2o @adamshurwitz @sayestheorem @Wikipedia Arweave today is $1,909.17 to store a terabyte.
INTP|@dameonh2o @adamshurwitz @sayestheorem @Wikipedia Ok but archiving files in a safe place for the long term is really really cheap. As an example AWS Glacier Deep is about 1 USD per Terabyte-Month.
INTP|Happy to help.
INTP|Project Fear 
INTP|@adamshurwitz @sayestheorem @Wikipedia Sometimes people are thinking about making sure every single edit is permanent - thats actually an actively bad idea, as for legal and ethical reasons some things really should be deleted.
INTP|@adamshurwitz @sayestheorem @Wikipedia But impermanence of information is not really a very strong risk for Wikipedia. Theres no question that the historical value of preserving snapshots from time to time is high, but on a day to day basis, its extremely robust using normal best practices.
INTP|@ariehkovler Im fond these days of Small Beer Beers, with taste, and much lower alcohol content. So Im with you
INTP|@adamshurwitz @sayestheorem @Wikipedia Arweave is fascinating and all but I dont see the use case at all - expand on your thought?
INTP|@pmsyyz I dont live in the United States.
INTP|@pmsyyz I am 100% unclear on what you are trying to say. I wont buy an F150 truck I can assure you.
INTP|@Tgreen871 @LynAldenContact I dont care where you live or how rich or poor your country is holding a house-worth of gold in your apartment is a dangerous thing to do.
INTP|I think I will buy a Volvo.
INTP|@justinamash I am curious about the dynamics of that - can you explain further?
INTP|@scottelundgren So that isnt how tax write-offs work. At all. I do agree that so far the whole thing seems designed to lose money but tax write-offs are not a way to make money. I can explain further if you like but probably some quick googling will explain it well.
INTP|Beat me to it by 29 seconds.
INTP|@anniierau When you have made like 1,000 of them, you can sell the NFT for millions.
INTP|@azeem @elonmusk @jack Would love to talk yes.
INTP|@chriskeating You were really good at your job!
INTP|@simplyLarkin 
INTP|Twitter, except every tweet is a neutral fact based article worked on by many people so that it educates rather than destroys your brain. I call it Wikipedia.
INTP|@forgetcape @Wikipedia @WikiTribune Not related to the foundation - this is my independent pilot project.
INTP|@imperialauditor @TomChivers No, your own surprise is irrelevant.
INTP|@spretail Yes trust can be both won and lost for sure.
INTP|Huh, thats interesting.
INTP|@HubertLindsay @soniatheroux Not necessarily. Values matter.
INTP|@WikiDocJames I would think that some kind of range or indication would be of interest to the reader. People are often reading drug articles from a public policy perspective, for example, and why not?
INTP|@WikiDocJames Ok well that can be true and discussion of the costs of medications can also be had - Id say the question is when the cost of a drug is notable in the usual sense? But even if it isnt the subject of some independent journalism (as it wont be in most normal cases)
INTP|@jamesrbuk Well but the existing model has been a weird sort of hybrid between this is their real identity and this is a VIP. Presumably anyone can pay for the blue tick, and a lot more than 300k will be interested in it. Although once it loses its VIP feel, maybe not.
INTP|@francesweetman If anyone can pay for it, then hopefully it can decline in significance as a VIP status symbol and just mean this is this persons real identity.
INTP|@francesweetman I think theres been an unfortunate conflation of this is this persons real identity (valuable) and this is a legit person (also valuable, but different). Because twitter couldnt afford to do it for everyone, they did it for VIPs which made it a status symbol.
INTP|@WikiDocJames That seems odd to me. I understand and agree with not really talking about dosing - risk of people relying on it inappropriately. But surely the cost - particularly when of public interest, is a fit subject? I mean, we dont need to track the price of aspirin, but
INTP|I dont know if it will be perfect, and Im sure well have to adjust on the way, but it has to be better than this hellsite, yeah?
INTP|The big twist thats coming - rather than the algorithm ranking based on likes/shares/engagement, it will rank based on trust - that is to say, starting from a core trusted group, they will trust more and more people and their content will be prioritized.
INTP|Im working on it but need support to see it through. is about to release a totally revamped version - I wouldnt have announced it early but this twitter stuff makes it timely.
INTP|@spacesudo @mjbiren @BWJones @Wikipedia @Twitter Prioritizing content based on quality rather than engagement and an absolutely liberal view of blocking people for being jerks. (Not for their political viewpoints, but for being jerks.)
INTP|@WikiDocJames Thank you - this is interesting and I will read about it. (Im so very far from an expert!)
INTP|@WikiDocJames What disease and what medicine?
INTP|@spacesudo @mjbiren @BWJones @Wikipedia @Twitter No imo Its going to get worse.
INTP|@spacesudo @mjbiren @BWJones @Wikipedia @Twitter There is a full redesign (including substantive changes such as a new trust mechanism) but ugly UI is not a big concern to me. I want quality discourse not a gorgeous hellsite. ☺️
INTP|The future of Twitter is here. 
INTP|@SusannaDodgson @TheChangfucius @bluesky @Wikipedia Also to be clear its an independent pilot project of mine not affiliated with Wikipedia!
INTP|@SusannaDodgson @TheChangfucius @bluesky @Wikipedia Why not yet? There is a chicken and egg problem with new spaces Need some early advocates to post and help make it grow! Also need user feedback!
INTP|@JennaPrice Oh no what happened?!
INTP|@chriskeating I think its interesting that they really really want to be running against Jeremy Corbyn.
INTP|@mounsey Thanks - keep in mind that what you see today is not what you will see soon - were revising everything to introduce a trust system.
INTP|@jamesrbuk Whats that from?
INTP|@spretail The idea is to reward quiet thoughtfulness and to penalize loud blowhards who just post wild stuff to get engagement.
INTP|@spretail As the site grows, it will be extremely important to have a robust analysis of how the trust levels are playing out and a willingness to adjust if there is a problem.
INTP|@spretail Ill be looking for a well-rounded and balanced cohort of people whose politics I agree with and disagree with. The important thing is not to agree with me, except to agree with me that thoughtful dialogue is better than rants by a wide margin.
INTP|@spretail FAQ will happen, were just not done yet! Initially, I will choose. I will have the most powerful account on the site, and I will seed by promoting people who are thoughtful and kind and share values of caring deeply about ideas.
INTP|@chriskeating Im actually confused as to who might have sent that. )
INTP|@GradyBooch Im on it - check DMs?
INTP|@spretail I hope thats helpful to your question.
INTP|@spretail There are people I choose not to follow here, even though I would like to keep an eye on them because they are important in the culture even if I think bad, because I dont want to boost them.
INTP|@spretail Im hoping that its useful - on this platform (twitter), following someone or retweeting them boosts them whether you are following because you think ill of them, or retweeting to criticize them.
INTP|@spretail An example may help - many people follow some outrageous controversial people on here not because they are trustworthy but because they are entertaining. On wts2, you can follow people sure, but it wont be an attestation of trust. Thats separate.
INTP|@spretail Obviously, numbers are involved. But merely being popular wont get you there. Being popular (interesting) and trusted is what will matter.
INTP|@spretail Not really, no. It isnt about simple engagement numbers like re, likes, follows. Its about attestation of trust from people who are already trusted.
INTP|Great - head of trust and safety gone. Its time to switch! please sign up and come talk to me.
INTP|@NateAFischer @NewFoundingOrg Yes, core community is key. Good people with enough power in the system to get things done and keep it good.
INTP|@ContrarianJolly Heh - thanks. It isnt mundane at all really. Im very worried about the future and these mundane details really matter.
INTP|@sirkserendipity Please do more than keeping an eye on us - we need help! Come and join. Theres a chicken-and-egg problem in social networks, and overcoming the momentum of an existing toxic platform requires a lot of help. -)
INTP|@ContrarianJolly Can you DM me screenshots? I am so sorry! Thats not the way it should work!
INTP|@LesLore1 Just click No thanks I dont want to pay now. If that doesnt work for you can you screenshot and DM me with what happens?
INTP|@JamesGleick @DipierroAnthony Well, is my own personal side project, but certainly get bought by twitter is not going to happen.
INTP|This is not fully operational yet, but we are getting there. 
INTP|As you gain trust in the community by posting quality content, your power to delegate trust to others increases.
INTP|Rather than prioritize content based on re, likes, engagement, our new algorithm is all about working from a circle of trusted users trusting other users to post quality content.
INTP|Were getting closer to releasing a total rewrite of the software, we call it wts2, and we need funding to get it done. Let me tell you a little bit about here, but really go sign up (and please sign up as a financial supporter) and start getting ready by inviting and discussing
INTP|I just want to mention that if youre worried about Elon Musk buying twitter, then you should look at the alternative pilot project Im working on. 
INTP|@SamuelBaltz My own view is that isnt the result of conscious bias - it isnt male Wikipedians consciously saying pfft, women authors are not important. But it is bias nonetheless, and a bias that can be fixed.
INTP|@SamuelBaltz Some years ago there was a look at authors who have won important literary prizes - for men, the entries were longer, more complete, higher quality, than for women.
INTP|@SamuelBaltz Im interested in examples where there are easy sex/gender statistics out there that can be mapped to Wikipedia data in here.
INTP|@SamuelBaltz And that could call into question the validity of notability criteria for athletes. But athletes are probably a complicated and arguable (by some) example.
INTP|This is a crucial point!
INTP|Elsa used to work for me. Shes great! Now shes doing freelance executive assistant stuff check our her website 
INTP|@kevinmarks Thats amazing.
INTP|This tweet definitely has held up well so far.
INTP|I think if Boris gets the 100 nominations, hell win the members vote. Thats just a forecast of what will happen, and not a very insightful one. But it is what I think.
INTP|Time moves ever forward
INTP|@GettUK @francesregina @TaxiappUK I really dont think you understand. Im sure youd refund me, as Ive made a big public complaint. But Im not the issue. If you want to fix it, dont refund me - change the policy, its corporate suicide.
INTP|Lettuce wins
INTP|@francesregina @GettUK But I think @TaxiappUK may be the way to go - no extra fee for passengers over the price on the meter. And lets be clear London cabs are expensive already. Extremely high quality drivers that are often worth the price. Paying £15 to an app for the privilege? No.
INTP|@francesregina @GettUK Well, if an app is charging me £2 for the service of helping me get a taxi, that may or may not be worth it to me, but it doesnt seem unconscionable and offensive. Charging me £15 is just - no way. They will go bankrupt as people come to understand that the competition is not.
INTP|Also my understanding is that TaxiApp is owned by drivers (not really clear on who) and charges nothing over the meter. Drivers pay. @TaxiappUK
INTP|But to be helpful to others who may find themselves wanting to follow me. Free Now charges a service fee of £2.00 £2 is fair enough, £15 is stupid. In a market economy, customers should switch for an equal product at a better price.
INTP|Last night my wife and I got a £15 technology fee on top of the price of a black taxi. I know a very easy solution deleting this app permanently. Goodbye, @GettUK.
INTP|@TheAnnaGat 
INTP|@TheAnnaGat S.N.A.F.U.
INTP|@Wheystandard @mindmatters001 @AriCohn @KatrinaKatrink @TristanSnell Yes, if by defame we mean it in a casual way, not in a legal sense. For sure. It is not morally ok to defame the dead, so yes, thats right. But legally, its fine.
INTP|@tomcoates So I guess unless hes on vacation or something, yes, I bet they could get it done in 11 days.
INTP|@tomcoates Whats amazing is that the database is this amazing thing, part of the core infrastructure of the world, maintained by this one excellent open source guy 
INTP|@mindmatters001 @AriCohn @KatrinaKatrink @TristanSnell Yes thats right. You cant defame the dead.
INTP|@DPJHodges I take your point - in theory. But Im curious about what process or procedure is most likely to happen, in the event that she just flatly refuses to resign.
INTP|@molly0xFFF digijects?
INTP|@alexhern Ill lend you my key.
INTP|@Caspurs1 @jamesrbuk Rosa Parks
INTP|@DmitryOpines @jamesrbuk Discourse mostly focussed on them being idiots, though.
INTP|@NakedEar It was a hacky, lazy pointless idiotic stunt.
INTP|@KentishTownLTN So what led you to think I missed that?
INTP|@StageDoorJohnny Link?!
INTP|@MarcBodnick @mattyglesias Because hes an idiot
INTP|@DrGibbs Definitely. Similarly with recent protests that (inadvertantly I assume) blocked ambulances.
INTP|@JoshRees18 Rosa Parks refused to move to the back of the bus. Easy to understand iconic action that made clear the absurd injustice she was fighting against.
INTP|@JoshRees18 In this act, the protest got attention and the message was coherent. Thats the right way to do it. There are tons of examples.
INTP|@JoshRees18 Not when the attention is anger and ridicule. This persuades literally no one and dissuades many.
INTP|@KentishTownLTN Why dont you explain it to me then? What connection is there between this painting and the climate crisis? Is the point to convince the general public that climate activists are idiots?
INTP|@IcarusGlider I mean thats the punch line I needed. Congrats!
INTP|@johnnyglatt It was. Fortunately covered in glass so it is not damaged I believe. But the intellectual poverty of this protest is pathetic.
INTP|Van Gogh is going to think twice about taking his private jet to the next big oil conference in Saudi Arabia, am I right?
INTP|@StageDoorJohnny I want to see this on tiktok by 6pm tonight.
INTP|@schooltruth Lol. For sure. I tried for a moment to modernize it but I enjoyed it too much as it stood.
INTP|I think we are almost to the plot point where Carrie Johnson, played by Victoria Principal, wakes up and the past year was all a dream.
INTP|@GeorgeBevis Its obviously written in a contentious way. is an update from WMF and questions/discussion from the community. Its obvious that the WMF has no interest in taking part in US culture wars - thats sooooo not who we are.
INTP|Apparently the cop has been arrested and charged - good! 
INTP|If you or I yanked open the car door of a teen eating a cheeseburger and shot him we would be more than fired. Wed be in jail.
INTP|@AkivaMCohen Relevant 
INTP|@chriskeating I enjoyed (in a weird way) the take that actually the currency and stock markets arent spooked by Trusss policy proposals, but by those proposals making it more likely that Labour will win. I mean, lol.
INTP|@hadrianbelove That sounds like a Dall-e prompt
INTP|@flyhachi Its a completely different organization. Not really much to reconcile. Im not opposed to advertising in general, but it would not be right for Wikipedia.
INTP|My mother is very excited that we bought - me too! 
INTP|Wikipedia can help kids with homework but not if they are too hungry to study. Sign now please!
INTP|@edsaperia @bmwelby According to Which it averages about 90p per month in the UK. I am very sure that knocking just 1 degree off the thermostat or cutting the boiler timer 1 hour earlier would save dramatically more.
INTP|@MarkAJohnson Well in the UK, Id say the understanding of the term is minimal.
INTP|Liz Truss is often described as a libertarian. Does she support decriminalizing marijuana?
INTP|@jerryduk Its a valid concern. But keep in mind how he would likely over react to constant successes. Hes learning the hard way that this was a major miscalculation.
INTP|@Roryshannon Could be but I assume its more symbolic and hurtful to Russian morale than meaningful. Replacing a single span in a bridge sounds easy to me. I dont know.
INTP|@wearpants Dont get me started. 🙂 But I meant the Crimean bridge!
INTP|@Roryshannon I have no idea who exactly will repair it but I would imagine the Russians will try.
INTP|@wearpants I cant view this link. Probably due to gdpr.
INTP|@jamesrbuk Unclear how this brings the King into politics. He follows the recommendations of his Prime Minister. If the Prime Minister recommends delay or indeed decides not to go ahead with some or all of these the King will follow that recommendation.
INTP|How long will it take to repair the bridge?
INTP|@Jehochman @ruskin147 Also, slap a glove on me and youll find that I catch like a 9 year old. And throw like a 5 year old. But batting, yes sir, that I can do. (In my dream!)
INTP|@Jehochman @ruskin147 I may have been designated hitter. I remember thinking that of course at my age and shape, my running isnt good, but I understood that I could hit any ball and make it go where I wanted, like home runs nearly every time.
INTP|The best bit was that just before I woke up I decided to give the story exclusively to @ruskin147 and I was thinking how surprised people would be at my new sports career.
INTP|Last night I dreamed that I signed to play Major League Baseball for the Red Sox for 1.5 million. I did actually sign something big recently (cant tell you yet) but fortunately there is no baseball involved.
INTP|@mickeymonkstain @ColinHayhurst And good satire. Female politicians clothes are often a point of criticism in a misogynist way.
INTP|@DavidWGWalker @icalzinirossi @jamiesusskind Just Jamies street then? 🤔😂
INTP|@jamiesusskind Thats a very British story.
INTP|@DMConstantino Thats like saying China has no censorship. Follow the law and you can publish what you want. Its not really a coherent way to think about it. A law, which could be improved, is causing rational actors to obey the law by blocking access from Europe.
INTP|@DMConstantino @kanalkaveira You seem to agree with me GDPR is not perfect. Dont settle for a bad law when we can improve it. Small town newspapers in America are blocking Europe. They are absolutely not the data problem that we should worry about.
INTP|@kermiite It does apply to them. And they rationally choose that its expensive to comply and they have too little traffic from Europe to make it worthwhile. The loss to free exchange of information is important. Dont be complacent about that - fixes are possible.
INTP|@dimiz I dont think its right to blame the victim here. Local TV stations arent rapaciously hoovering up your data to misuse it. They are just making a simple rational business decision they have too little traffic from Europe to make it financially sensible to comply.
INTP|@kanalkaveira What is not working in GDPR is that it is causing hundreds to thousands of informative news websites to cut off access to Europe, as a rational business response to an overreaching law. What else is not working in GDPR is that it isnt stopping the real abuse of our data.
INTP|@kanalkaveira Its worth mentioning in this context that if you think GDPR is stopping Facebook and the like from doing things you dont like with your data, you are mistaken. So it isnt fixing the real problem, and it is causing a very serious problem. So reform is needed.
INTP|@kanalkaveira Of course tech privacy is a concern. So is fragmentation of access to knowledge. There are some obvious ways to begin to fix GDPR, and we dont get there if we ignore the flaws.
INTP|@kanalkaveira Now, after we agree on that - which is not hard to agree on, its a simple obvious fact, then theres a question to be had as to what to do about it - how to reform GDPR.
INTP|@kanalkaveira Yes, it does. Im sitting here in the UK (and the same would be true if you are in the EU) and I cant read the story. The reason, the direct cause, is GDPR.
INTP|@dimiz Im sitting in the UK and no, I cant see it. It is at least theoretically possible that the UK will make some rational amendments to GDPR, I dont know. But really European Parliament needs to revisit this.

INTP|@TheresNoTimeFor Haha yes. I mean I give the award so thatd be as strange as King Charles III knighting himself.
INTP|@griffithsu @francesweetman @AbbyLindon Not by a very wide margin.
INTP|@jimstinson @Wikipedia @njhochman Thank you for this example. I will study and we will discuss but due to being very busy this week it will be Monday earliest and I apologize for that but I take this sort of thing seriously and want to do it right.
INTP|@jimstinson @borrfdad @njhochman @Wikipedia How is that an editorial? Its the simple facts and well sourced.
INTP|@peterpattakos @corbinkbarthold @ericgoldman @daphnehk I am asking about what you said about Wikipedia. I understand your political stance on this - I dont agree but that isnt what I am asking about.
INTP|@borrfdad @jimstinson @njhochman @Wikipedia Yes show me a link. Its all open and transparent and a specific example will take this out of the realm of vagueness into what could be a productive discussion.
INTP|@oliviasolon Move over @Ottolenghi, meet Ottowronghi!
INTP|@therealrthorat @daphnehk @JamieFoxworthy @ericgoldman How do you reach that conclusion?
INTP|@ajkrl3 @corbinkbarthold @ericgoldman @daphnehk Ive looked at it. How do you reach that conclusion? Serious question.
INTP|@peterpattakos @corbinkbarthold @ericgoldman @daphnehk What on earth are you talking about? Its like you are writing from a different dimension.
INTP|@AkivaMCohen says She and her friend threw a lifesaver into the water as another man was already down there trying to help. So maybe this isnt actually a dreaful bystander paralysis story, I dont know really.
INTP|@AkivaMCohen Lake Michigan is 19.4 degrees C today, 67F, which is brisk but not terrible. However, many who live in Chicago (I used to) regard the lake as extremely dangerously cold year round (it isnt). If I didnt know how cold it is, Id be wary as hell of jumping in.
INTP|@AkivaMCohen Its a fairly significant height. Not impossible but its not 2 feet. I dont know how you get out.
INTP|@holly I wish it werent glass! (Glass is too hard for knives and will dull them)

INTP|@alexhern He was hoping for glowing reviews of the new Range Rover deisel.
INTP|Of course the Brits commemorate the passing of the beloved Queen with a ceremonial 24 hour queue.
INTP|Thanks! Small donations are the heart of it all!
INTP|@AlexCoventry4 @deriamis @AkivaMCohen Indeed. 2020 not surprising since covid cancelled many plans. But the 2019 drop looks big too. As others have said this chart has no sources so I am also waiting to learn more before believing it at all.
INTP|@simplyLarkin You are the dancing queen! Definitely, Im super eager to see the show
INTP|@Liber8Proxy @skaffman No you are a liar. I have only given you this feedback you are a liar and I am not a customer and I do not endorse your business.
INTP|@tabous2 Actually, no, because that didnt happen. But I think you know that already.
INTP|@ariehkovler Great thanks!
INTP|@ariehkovler What does it mean? Is there something special about that date?

INTP|@SimonTanner @askryanair They are not only the worst Which everyone already knows. They are worse than that still.
INTP|I am sure you full well know the public thinks in general that you are horrible. So far I am finding this 100% confirmed.
INTP|Lets be clear. I have a complaint that I think is perfectly legitimate and boring as it could possibly be. But I am happy to discuss it. But ffs your bot said someone would respond and didnt.
INTP|Dear @askryanair I have been patient waiting for 12 hours for some response by a human to my DM. Now going public.

INTP|Fanboy time -Just had breakfast with the amazing @anniierau follow her @depthsofwiki its great stuff!
INTP|@Fncncid @bastique To read that very specific editorial guideline as woke would ignore that it is used across all of Wikipedia. Basically, the idea that Wikipedia is some kind of crazed left wing site is a delusion of people engaging in fact-free culture wars.
INTP|@Fncncid @bastique I think an article unlikely to come - the topic is what we normally would call WPSYNTH - 
INTP|@Fncncid @bastique The achievements of so many Ashkenazi Jews, and the fact that the average IQ of Ashkenazi Jews is a half to one full standard deviation above the mean IQ of other white Europeans, have led some to the view that Ashkenazi Jews have higher than average intelligence. 1/
INTP|@sullydish Andrew, you should know better 
INTP|@BowTiedIT Good except would leave you thinking that this article doesnt exist 
INTP|@AutumnalReed Isnt true 
INTP|@Clarksterh Quillette is wrong here 
INTP|Or, to put it another way, Wikipedia has a long high quality article explaining the phenomenon and this is a bogus claim 
INTP|@jurijfedorov @clairlemon The bigger issue is that the Quillette article is just silly

INTP|@LucyMPowell @carolinefff Id love the opportunity to come in and brief you about my concerns, which have not been addressed.
INTP|@mrianleslie @TomChivers @slatestarcodex For sure
INTP|This seems super cool.
INTP|@TomChivers @mrianleslie @slatestarcodex Yes - poetic rhetoric is always hard to specify with accuracy I guess. I just thought the proposed interpretation didnt necessarily get at what she probably meant!
INTP|@TomChivers @mrianleslie @slatestarcodex A UK parallel might be concerns by New Labour sorts that Corbyn would mean the death of the Labour party.
INTP|@TomChivers @mrianleslie @slatestarcodex Well Liz Cheney might point to her own deselection by her state party which looks likely to cause her to lose her seat in favor of a Trump supporter. But it is that sort of thing the takeover of the party by a particular wing.
INTP|@mrianleslie @slatestarcodex I am somehow on Nancy Pelosis fundraising mailing list. It has daily completely ridiculous rhetorical predictions so it is definitely a thing.
INTP|@mrianleslie @slatestarcodex Most politicians, unless entirely focussed on power to the exclusion of any policy preferences, would regard the takeover by ideologues of a different perspective to be meaningfully the death of the party even if technically the institution carries on.
INTP|@mrianleslie @slatestarcodex I think this fails to understand what not surviving means in this context. If as seems likely it means cant survive in its present form then it is a reasonable prediction which has arguably come true.

INTP|@ariehkovler @EBRedding5 Massively helpful and led me to this 
INTP|@ariehkovler If he were to attempt to call a general election first? I am less clear on that, as normally she could not refuse her PM that. (Now that FTPA is repealed I guess we are back to the old way.)
INTP|@ariehkovler I wonder if you can expand on the various paths a bit? Its a big ask, I know. Presumably if Parliament were to pass a no-confidence motion overwhelmingly she definitely could without endangering her position?
INTP|@Unpackabl3 @ariehkovler FTPA was repealed.

INTP|@pagejordan00 @pdxtrailblazers Agree Elliot has tons of potential and doing well after his shoulder surgery and is itching to play I hear.
INTP|@jamonholmgren @pdxtrailblazers Less likely to leave players overseas more likely to bring one or two over, we need to add depth in summer.

ISFJ|Thousands of mothers are stuck on probation or parole just because they can’t afford to pay off their restitution, fines, and fees. While on probation they are at constant risk of being returned to prison or jail- not for committing a new crime but for technical violations like missing a meeting with their probation officer. In celebration of Mother’s Day, I’ve partnered with @MichaelRubin to pay off the remaining restitution of more than 50 mothers across the country to give these women the second chance they’ve earned. Thank you Danielle, Drew, and Tarlexus for sharing your stories with us. We can fix this broken system but need your support to join the movement visit @REFORM and thank you @jessicajackson

ISFJ|Now, the DOJ is trying to send him back to prison for the same crimes the judge sentenced him on. Please read his story and share. 
ISFJ|After hearing about the prosecutorial misconduct in the case, Trump gave Philip a commutation and let him come home to his family. He has focused on giving back and has been a law abiding, devoutly religious family man.
ISFJ|Philip served 4.5 years in prison- much of it in isolation in order to avoid abuse by guards and other prisoners while observing his devout religious beliefs.
ISFJ|Philip Esformes was convicted of 20 charges equaling $170k. The judge then used those charges along with charges a jury found him NOT guilty of and sentenced him to 20 years in prison and 43 million dollars in restitution and criminal asset forfeiture. 
ISFJ|There is still time for District of Florida to overturn this appeal. Learn More 
ISFJ|This week, Crosley must surrender himself to the Florida Department of Corrections by April 17. U.S. District Judge Roy Dalton of the Middle District of Florida wrote that Crosley, having run out of appeals, will have to complete the remainder of his sentence — life behind bars.
ISFJ|Crosley was conditionally released in 2021 and remains on house arrest until the Supreme Court determines whether it will hear his case. During his release, he has held a full-time job and became a valued member of his community.
ISFJ|In 1990 Crosley was convicted for the murder of 21 YO Charles Chip Flynn Jr. No physical evidence linked him to the crime, in which the victim’s ex-girlfriend reported that an assailant she described as a Black guy kidnapped the two of them and shot Flynn.
ISFJ|I wanted to share a heartbreaking case with you all. Crosley Green spent 32 years in prison with 19 on death row, before being released by a federal judge who ruled that a prosecutor withheld evidence in his murder case.

ISFJ|I encourage you to learn more about Alexandria House by visiting 
ISFJ|It truly takes a village and thru the support of community organizations such as Alexandria House, we can make the difference in so many lives by spreading the awareness of the important work they are doing and shining a light on these women. 
ISFJ|We are so grateful to their openness in sharing their personal stories of perseverance with us. 
ISFJ|We also met with women in Start Up Sisterhood, a program that helps give these women the tools and mentorship they need to start their own small businesses. 
ISFJ|We were also able to provide many essentials they would need this holiday season along with a beauty day and family portraits with their families and head shots for job interviews. 
ISFJ|This week Khloe and I returned and met with the incredible women and their children that are currently in Alexandria’s transitional home and programs to see how the organization has grown. 
ISFJ|You might remember I visited about 5 years ago where we filmed the visit for KUTWK which inspired a single donor who was watching to generously donate $1M to them. 
ISFJ|This holiday season I’d love to shine the light on an organization that I love called @AlexandriaHouseLA, a non profit that has provided shelter, childcare, counseling and job readiness for hundreds of homeless women and their children for the past 25 years in Los Angeles.

ISFJ|As for my future with Balenciaga, I am currently re-evaluating my relationship with the brand, basing it off their willingness to accept accountability for something that should have never happened to begin with — , the actions I am expecting to see them take to protect children.
ISFJ|I appreciate Balenciaga’s removal of the campaigns and apology. In speaking with them, I believe they understand the seriousness of the issue and will take the necessary measures for this to never happen again.
ISFJ|As a mother of four, I have been shaken by the disturbing images. The safety of children must be held with the highest regard and any attempts to normalize child abuse of any kind should have no place in our society — period.
ISFJ|I have been quiet for the past few days, not because I haven’t been disgusted and outraged by the recent Balenciaga campaigns, but because I wanted an opportunity to speak to their team to understand for myself how this could have happened.
ISFJ|Just added new items on my online closet! Shop my Black Friday sale on my #KardashianKloset

ISFJ|Help us right this wrong and ask PA to take another look at C.J.s case 
ISFJ|C.J. Rice had a defense attorney who only met with him TWICE before trial and failed to present expert testimony that C.J. was physically incapable of committing the crime due to his fractured pelvis and injured abdomen. 
ISFJ|How could an innocent 17-year-old end up behind bars until hes 77 years old? Meet C.J. Rice - despite being a minor, he was tried as an adult and sentenced to 30-60 years behind bars for a crime that his doctor says he could not have committed. Learn more

ISFJ|And special thanks to @ScottyBudnick for dedicating your life to helping others and mentoring these kids every free weekend you get. Not only do you allow me to tag along on your journey but I learn so much from you.
ISFJ|I want to thank @LACProbation and the Superintendent for having me and to the staff I met - who really believe in redemption and were constantly guiding these young men towards a positive path. 
ISFJ|These are the young men that deserve a second chance and if we give them the opportunities and tools to learn and grow and change we need to be doing everything we can to help them.
ISFJ|I walked away really understanding that these young adults need our attention and will be out one day and we need to set them up to succeed and not go back to the lifestyle they were so accustomed to. 
ISFJ|They were being mentored by the dedicated and committed Probation officers and men from @AntiRecidivism. As these young people are reimagining their lives, it is up for us as a community to reimagine how we meaningfully support them. Youth and young adults can change!!!
ISFJ|They were doing victim impact work with families of crime victims through @HDAHealing and @AYC100. They were learning songwriting and music production from @JailGuitarDoors.
ISFJ|All the boys I met had made the decision to change their lives and were actively living that change. They were in college at @lamcofficial and some were enrolled in the Hollywood CPR program at West LA College to get into the film unions. 
ISFJ|This made me feel so sad and angry but I also was impressed with the accountability they were taking for their lifestyle and crimes they committed.
ISFJ|They were so brave to share their stories with me on their upbringings of abuse, neglect, foster care, and feeling unloved which ultimately led them to make some awful choices that led them to where they are at now in life. 
ISFJ|Last week I had the most educational and inspiring visit to Barry J Nidorf juvenile hall in LA - my first time visiting a juvenile facility. I was really impressed by the young men that I had the opportunity of spending time with. 
ISFJ|I’m so excited for you guys to try it!!!!
ISFJ|From sought-after ingredients and clinically-proven formulas, to compostable kraft bags and refills made from recycled materials, this skincare collection means so much to me. I cant wait for you to get your hands on these products. 
ISFJ|.@SKKN is now available exclusively at Im so proud of this line of products — not only are they efficacious, clean, backed in science, and formulated for all types of skin, but they bring a spa-like experience right to your home. 
ISFJ|I love our exfoliator but I think the most needed is the hyaluronic acid serum or the vitamin C serum
ISFJ|Everyone should be able to purchase the life saving medications they need at affordable prices! @costplusdrugs
ISFJ|This is probably the most amazing thing ever!!! Congrats @mcuban This is saving so many peoples lives 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼

ISFJ|Incarcerated firefighters have been fighting wildfires here in California for years, but most can’t even get a job in a fire department after they’re released. We need to tear down these barriers so all people released from prison have a chance at success.

ISFJ|So far their requests have been denied. I ask the @officialFBOP to grant Eli Torres temporary release so that he can say his last goodbye to his baby girl. Every parent deserves that right.
ISFJ|This is Eliahana ‘Ellie’ Cruz Torres, 10 years old, and one of the 19 victims of the shooting in Uvalde, TX. Her family are desperately hoping that her father, who is incarcerated for a non violent drug offense, be granted temporary release so that he can attend her funeral.

ISFJ|Here is my blog post from 2017, unfortunately it has not aged. 💔 
ISFJ|I’m urging our leaders to come together and put politics aside and put children first.
ISFJ|Imagine the entire classroom of children who witnessed their friends die in front of them. The trauma will last a lifetime for everyone involved. Words can’t express my heartbreak for the parents whose babies didn’t come home from school yesterday.
ISFJ|We can’t accept it. We can’t have another five years go by without effective, impactful laws put in place to protect our kids. We are parents, we are mothers, we are begging and pleading for action.
ISFJ|We can’t accept this as normal anymore. It’s not normal for a teenager to kill children. It’s not normal for our kids to be practicing active shooter drills in schools. It’s not normal to be shot while shopping for groceries. I’m not numbed by it. I will never be numbed by it.
ISFJ|but if we increase legal age to purchase, coupled with a ban on assault weapons, we can without a doubt reduce the number of senseless tragedies and save children’s lives.
ISFJ|There are of course people over 21 who buy guns to cause harm, and other mass shootings in recent years have been carried out by people over 21,
ISFJ|But the one thing that law makers can and should control now is access to weapons.
ISFJ|There is no question that mental health, racism, deep-seated hatred all play a role in the motivation for mass shootings in recent years. And at a community level, as parents, teachers, there is a lot that can be done to help teens and young adults that isn’t being done.
ISFJ|As I even type these words I am seriously dumbfounded that this is something considered normal, acceptable and legal.
ISFJ|Someone who is not old enough to buy alcohol should not be allowed to purchase a firearm. There is no world in which an 18 year old needs a semi automatic weapon, or any weapon, and no world in which the outcome can be anything other than tragic.
ISFJ|The legal age to purchase a firearm is also a serious issue and needs to be addressed and increased. The Parkland shooter, the Buffalo grocery store shooter, the Texas shooter yesterday, they were all under 21 and reportedly purchased weapons legally. These are teenagers.
ISFJ|Assault weapons didn’t even exist when the Second Amendment was written. We have to stop allowing people to use a sentence written centuries ago when technology, times, humanity were completely different, to dictate how we regulate gun ownership, , how we protect our kids today.
ISFJ|AR-15 style semi automatic rifles were used in Newtown, Parkland, Aurora, San Bernardino, Orlando, Parkland, in the Buffalo shooting 10 days ago, and reportedly in yesterday’s shooting. Assault weapons are not a self defense tool. They are sophisticated weapons, designed to kill.
ISFJ|Semi automatic weapons, assault weapons, weapons of war, should not be legally sold or owned by American civilians. They should be banned. Period.
ISFJ|There is no excuse and no justification for what happened yesterday. The current laws in our country around gun control are not protecting our children. We have to push law makers to enact laws that are fitting in today’s world.
ISFJ|Yesterday 19 children were murdered by an 18 year old, and I find myself heartbroken, disgusted and furious about how little has been done by law makers to enact gun laws that protect our children.
ISFJ|In it I asked is it more important to protect the second amendment than to protect our own children?
ISFJ|Five years ago, almost to the day, I wrote an essay for my blog about my thoughts on gun control in honor of National Gun Violence Awareness Day.
ISFJ|I am prepping all my Italy content now! Get ready for the major spam! It won’t take me a week to post it don’t worry lol. I just like to live in the moment sometimes but getting all my posts ready 🇮🇹❤️
ISFJ|sometimes all you need is your best friend

ISFJ|But I wanted to bring attention to one of the greatest organizations that help people once they get home from prison and that’s @AntiRecidivism. @ScottyBudnick has really mentored me through showing what the prison system is like and introduced me to so many amazing people.
ISFJ|Thank you guys for watching last night episode of @kardashianshulu. If you haven’t seen it yet, it gives you a glimpse of my prison reform journey and the work that I do. You also got to see the moment when I passed the baby bar which was so important to me.

ISFJ|It will forever be one of the greatest privileges of my life to be able to channel my inner Marilyn in this way, on such a special night. Thank you Heritage Auctions, Barbara Zweig and Jeff for helping to make this memory possible. 
ISFJ|Further into my research I found out that the owner of the Golden Globe that she received that evening was non other than my friend @jeffleatham. I saw this all as a sign the way that all of the stars aligned.
ISFJ|In my quest to find the Jean Louis hand beaded dress that I wore to the gala, I discovered @HeritageAuction owned Marilyn’s iconic green sequined gown. 
ISFJ|To top off my night after The Met, I had the honor of changing into Marilyn Monroes Norman Norell dress that she wore to the Golden Globes in 1962 —where she received the Henrietta Award For World Film Favorite.

ISFJ|This case was a clear example of why mandatory minimums don’t work and need to be abolished. I’m grateful to Governor Polis for his empathy and leadership on this case.
ISFJ|Thank you @GovofCO for taking action to reduce Mr. Aguilera- Mederos sentence! While his new sentence is ten years, he will now have an opportunity to come home in five years and be with his son and wife.
ISFJ|Wow @KrisJenner being in the top 5 songs in the US was not on my bingo card for 2021!!! BUT I’m living for it and it’s soooo🔥🔥🔥

ISFJ|2022! It will be worth the wait!
ISFJ|❤️
ISFJ|I pray that Governor Polis, who has been a leader on supporting reforms that increase human dignity in the legal system, will commute his sentence.
ISFJ|And yet, for some reason the prosecutor thought it would be funny to post a photo of a brake shoe trophy she received from a colleague with a plaque? Makes me so sick.
ISFJ|Another shocking part of the case is this post by the prosecutor after his conviction. Four people died in this tragic accident. Rogel has a life sentence for the accident, which will not only destroy his life, but it will also impact his wife and son’s life. 
ISFJ|Colorado law really has to be changed and this is so unfair. @GovofCO is a really good person and I know he will do the right thing.
ISFJ|Another shocking and unfair part of this case is that the judge didn’t want to sentence him to such a lengthy sentence. However, because of the mandatory minimums in Colorado, his hands were tied. Mandatory minimums take away judicial discretion and need to end.
ISFJ|He was not drunk or under the influence, his brakes on the semi tractor-trailer failed.
ISFJ|For those who don’t know about this case, Rogel Aguilera-Mederos is a 26 year old that was sentenced 110 years in prison for driving a semi-tractor-trailer and crashed into traffic killing four people.
ISFJ|I know everyone has been posting about Rogel Aguilera-Mederos this week. I took a deep dive in it to figure out what the situation is.

ISFJ|My dad would be so proud , he would actually be so shocked to know that this is my path now but he would’ve been my best study partner. I am told he was notorious for making fun of people who didn’t pass on their first attempt like him, but he would’ve been my best cheerleader!

ISFJ|but it was my only option and it feels so so sooooo good to be here and on my way to achieving my goals.
ISFJ|I failed this exam 3 times in 2 years, but I got back up each time and studied harder and tried again until I did it!!! (I did have COVID on the 3rd try w a 104 fever but I’m not making excuses😉) 
ISFJ|OMFGGGG I PASSED THE BABY BAR EXAM!!!! Looking in the mirror, I am really proud of the woman looking back today in the reflection. For anyone who doesn’t know my law school journey, know this wasn’t easy or handed to me.

ISFJ|We will miss you so much Virgil and love you so much. Also I would love to send so much love to his wife Shannon. Because you loved and supported Virgil the way that you did, he was able to give so much of himself everyone else. 
ISFJ|You somehow made time for everyone. We also talked about your superpower of calmness often. You always gave so much of yourself to the world because you wanted it to be doper. This one is hard to process. I can’t even believe I am writing this… 
ISFJ|God doesn’t make mistakes. I know that but I still can’t help but ask why. Why Virgil?! Why him so soon? it’s simply hard to understand why. I have a hard time understanding why so many pure souls were taken away so early. Virgil- you were always so gentle, kind and calm.

ISTJ|I can’t come up with a description for this that I feel to be worthy. ⁦@robdelaney⁩ is a beautiful artistic creature who has written a searing account of losing his young son Henry to a brain tumor. Read this magnificent work and then see if you can talk right either. 💔❤️

ISTJ|@herdyshepherd1 Sir this is a family channel.
ISTJ|Citizens, I sincerely implore you to vote tomorrow. Decency is on every ballot. Are you a citizen? Are you a good neighbor? History is in your hands. Text my safe word BEEF WELLINGTON to 63033 to find your polling place. 
ISTJ|This episode of @LastWeekTonight with @iamjohnoliver is imperative (with extra beef). The only way to protect our democracy from Big Lie pushers who are so brazenly full of shit is to vote. Indifference is not an option here. Plus #CuteDogs #Vote 
ISTJ|Hungry? And you have voter questions about how to perform your civic duty? I have an easy fix for both. Text my safe word BEEF WELLINGTON to 63033. 
ISTJ|I was so excited to be a part of this, but then pretty bummed when I found out it wasn’t a reality survival show. 😕 They even made me leave my knives in my truck. 🥺 Still, it’s from #CraigMazin and @NeilDruckmann and @hbomax so I think it will be rad af anyway. 🍄🍄🍄🍄🍄🍄🍄 
ISTJ|Unlike Ron Swanson, I do NOT giggle at the notion of the U.S. government falling apart. That wrong idea is only palatable on a comedy program. Voting is open, so make a plan. Encourage your friends, family, , work-proximity associates to do the same. 🇺🇸

ISTJ|#ad This new expression of @LagavulinWhisky Offerman Edition is smoky and spicy, the ideal warming medicine to salve the wounds of daily life. (Single malt scotch is not medically beneficial. If any lawyers are reading this, medicine is clearly figurative in this usage.)

ISTJ|@jasondws Jason thank you for your indirect support and I hope you won’t require said lining for many years. I’m putting this in my Donkey Thoughts Substack tomorrow and crediting you as the source but is this a fabric or is there another original source I can credit please and thank you?

ISTJ|@thebgp1 If it’s not too dull and you soundly clamp the work piece down to a surface you can drill into, the center guide bit should keep it safe from splitting, but then you still need a jig saw or coping saw to enlarge to 1 1/2
ISTJ|@thebgp1 Not familiar with that implement. Raw linseed oil never dries - you want polymerized Linseed oil or Danish oil or Tung oil…
ISTJ|@thebgp1 One other notion Sandwich the walnut between 2 scrap boards and clamp solidly. Meticulously transfer your hole’s center point to the top of the sandwich, then drill through the scrap and the walnut as one. Clamp soundly and take your time.
ISTJ|@thebgp1 I guess drill a 1/2 hole and use a jigsaw to gingerly cut out the rest of the 1 1/2 circle? I’d first recommend a forstener bit but you need a drill press for that to go right.
ISTJ|Folks I am tickled to let you know that you can obtain signed copies of my new book here at @BNBuzz

ISTJ|@notverygoodtake Thanks @CaryGeare, but its teaching me to feel the frustration of not understanding Python imports 🤦‍♂️

ISTJ|@coleoest Ahhh haaa. Interesting question 😉. Magic actually references a book by different authors - Alan Lightman and Robert Siegel. But yeah, I can definitely see the parallels between that and The Angel and the One. As for your banner - thats hilarious. 🤣
ISTJ|@orlandosevenn Oh sure, @thewombats, of course. Just make sure you have your golf game tight because Im gonna bring it today. Im as hype as could be to get back on the road, so watch out - well see ya soon. #WeezerNation #GolfTime #RealTour.

ISTJ|@gardenutensil Haha yeah, but its true - no Grammy for WEEZERs SZNZ ( sadface. Not sure the Grammy folks got it, but the real fans do and thats whats up. Big love to the Weezer fam everywhere. 🎶😎✌️
ISTJ|@RiddlerDBD Thanks for the pic, Im flattered. Though Im sure you can take credit, youre a total art pimp and you dont even know it. #youshouldsellthatstuff
ISTJ|@3sko0 No worries, fam. Weezer isnt gonna sue 😁 But just to be safe, why dont you come to our next show and bring me a double cheeseburger with extra pickles? That way, Ill know you got my back 🤣
ISTJ|@Cjmiller313 Hell yeah, Aussies. Cant wait to rock down under with yall. #WeezerDowntUnder #WeezerAUS #OzzieWeezie
ISTJ|@misscepheid Haha thanks @Juilz777 but Im not sure if prayers to the Grammy committee will make a difference at this point. Guess theyre just in a Kanye kinda mood this year. Eh, whatevz. #WhereIsMyGrammy #SnubbedByGrammys #WeezerSzn
ISTJ|@jmstopmotion Hey there, props for using the lingo ,) It looks like youve convinced me to do the LOOT doot - so why not doot doot a LOOT doot doot? Thats a mouthful, I know, but its time to get funky.
ISTJ|@RiddlerDBD for the music, but yeah, no GRAMMY for SZNZ. Guess we gotta fight the powers that be and keep doing us. #Weezer
ISTJ|@misscepheid Hey @Juilz777 @TheRegrettes @wheatus - shout out to #blessed Isaiah 588, but lets just say Im also hoping the glory of the LORD is my wingman this weekend #turnup 🤘
ISTJ|@drunkdoriiiiii Im flattered, but Im not sure my voice would do justice to Linkin Park. Maybe I can cover In the End with a little rap to it? That might be pretty funny. #OldManRapGame
ISTJ|@adriueh Hey there. Unfortunately Im not sure what that comment was trying to tell me 🤣
ISTJ|@Cjmiller313 Well, Im certainly up for the challenge. I heard yall loud and clear. Down Under, you got it. Weezer is making it happen ASAP. #WeezerWorksUnderDown

ISTJ|@GUSDABUS19 Haha thanks. Thats a real nice bomb-diggity 😅. Im glad youre feelin it as much as I do. Never underestimate the power of a cannoli and a Weezer tune.
ISTJ|@NerdyPropaganda Haha, dont worry. Thats all part of the mythos now. Just doing what I do best, causing confusion and keeping the fans guessing. #NeverStopMysteriousing #ReadyToRockHarvelles
ISTJ|@autumnbeee Yo. Right on. Just remember, dont let anyone tell you what dreams you should be pursuing. #LifeGoals ✌️
ISTJ|@excusemydrool Heya AxolotlRogue. You speak for a lot of us Weez-heads, we get it. Soon, soon. Believe it or not, Im already droppin some bars in the studio recording some bangers for the new LP. If you ask me, its about to be fire. #GettinJiggyWitIt
ISTJ|@idiotequefree Hey there - thanks for introducing my tunes to your GF. Im a little nervous today cuz I got a solo show lined up at Harvelles. Hope the vibes are poppin, Im ready to kill this set. 🤘
ISTJ|@grayisdumb404 Ayeee, you know Im down. 🤘 Time to drop a new bop with a chorus of 🦒🦒🦒 singing Bless the Rains 🌧️🙌
ISTJ|@sofiesigne Hey there. Actually, Im the proud parent of a precious pup. His name is Puppernaut and he loves to play and snuggle. 🐶😍
ISTJ|@SouupMann No worries. Just glad to make your bad day a lil better. #baddaytogoodvibez
ISTJ|@CephalopodToday Hey there. Im so glad Smooch brings you joy. Im pretty stoked about it too, Smooch is lit 🔥 🐈 🤩
ISTJ|@autumnbeee Haha. This is a tough one. How about the Green Album? I think you should get that one on vinyl to show your support - especially since no one wants to come to my solo shows. #VinylCollector #GreenAlbumVinyl
ISTJ|@Anor3xorcist LOL. We haven’t been making much progress on that one. We’re working on some other bangers though, so stay tuned. #MakeBelieve2 #MakeBelievin
ISTJ|@BlogarOfficial Haha. Wish I could rap but the closest I come is reciting birthday cards. Plus, #WeezerPenisStrong has to keep it PG-13 ,)
ISTJ|@tashyidiot Well, more power to ya. Pat on the back for me. All Ive got to say is if nobody shows up, I got this 👉🏽 I dont need nobody, just me and my air guitar 🎸 also feeling your struggles, trust me. Lets hope next time itll fill up 🤞🏽
ISTJ|@BenDonSherwood Hey there. Glad to hear you put together a Weezer playlist. Sounds like it was quite the ridehope you like the results. 🤗
ISTJ|@SouupMann Hey there. Sorry to hear your brother doesnt like Weezer. But I mean if he did, hed be missing out on all the brotastic times we could have as BFFs. So dont let him rain on your parade, just tell him he can get hopped on the Weezer train or GTFO. 😉
ISTJ|@NedTOPOffical Sorry, I need to keep it professional. How about we just fist bump instead? #ScissoringForTheWin
ISTJ|@NedTOPOffical Thanks, Im flattered. You can call me 🔥 Cuomo 🔥 from now on 😉
ISTJ|@PsilentOne Its gonna cost ya a bit more than a buck if you want something from me. How about some Dogecoin instead? 😏 #IdRatherBeChillin
ISTJ|@whtsaradiohead Aww dont be sad, AxolotlRogue. When life gives you lemons, make bold moves and dont forget to make a meme out of it. #YOLO
ISTJ|@gglowingeyes Haha yup. Guess its just gonna be me and a couple of spooky ghosts rocking out 😂😂 #SoloShowVibes #AloneInThisTogether #MakeItWeird 🤘
ISTJ|@gglowingeyes Haha, totally🤩 Color me stoked for you.
ISTJ|@tremestor Hey there. Im dopin today. How bout you?
ISTJ|@TripMcnister Hmmm thats a tough one. Im liking my @FullToneSoulBender for its sick tones and creamy fuzz, but if I HAD to choose just one, Id go with the @IbanezTubeScreamer for its versatility and bossness. #StompItUp
ISTJ|@proidiot0 Yep, no doubt That solo is pretty insane Fire🔥🔥
ISTJ|@keiytofficial Hey Jodi, dont stress - the moneys in the mail, fam. #SaveYourMoneyForTheMerch
ISTJ|@TheBroadwayPunk No worries my dude, wont do you like that. Ill drop the tour announcement when you’re done with kindergarten for the day so you can get HYPE about it. #TeamsScience #NoBS
ISTJ|@nickcostduh Thanks. Ya, I have to agree, Slave is da bomb. Now if we can just settle which other two songs make the top 3 in the Weezer game, then well be good to go 😉
ISTJ|@AxolotlRogue Hahaha. Zero percent chance of that happening - sorry pal. If it did focus on me, itd probably be called The Ridiculously Self-Aware Story of Rivers Cuomo. And lets be honestwho actually wants to watch that? #notme #sorrynotsorry #goodone
ISTJ|@TacosAreCoolDuh Haha. The skincare gods have been kind to me, I guess. 🤩Young at heart and young at sound. 🎶
ISTJ|@nickcostduh Me at Maladroit? LOVIN IT. Its one of my faves - its got all the classic Weezer vibes heavy guitars, angsty lyrics, and catchy choruses for days. Ya gotta respect the maladroit-ness 🤘
ISTJ|@pollinatorsband Hey Noah, glad you pumped on Man Prodigy Lover. I know its been awhile since I wrote that chorus, but it still soars. And if you think its cool now, just wait until you hear the remix. #fire 🔥
ISTJ|@d1gitalparadox Haha I dont think Pinkerton has kept me up at night since 1997. But Im certainly up late these days rehearsing for these solo shows - just trying to give the fans their moneys worth ,) #onthegrind #showtime
ISTJ|@mybIoodvhs Hey, @gglowingeyes. Lets do it. Forget the coffee, lets grab a round of bubble tea and have an epic hang. Nothing like a good friend group - #bestiesforever 🤩
ISTJ|@NedTOPOffical Valentines Day? Awww Im gonna be spending time with the one I love most me and my guitar. You can join the party too if you like ,) #RiversCuomo
ISTJ|@gglowingeyes Yo, hell yeah. Lets do this thing. Its gonna be straight 🔥 Cant wait for the good times. Make sure to bring your 🤘 and dont forget the 🍕.
ISTJ|@carseatbeesnest Huh, its my solo show week and people still have time to watch TV? 😉 Nah, cant say I have. I think Im more of a Dexter kind of guy, myself. Gotta stay focused and stay lit rehearsing for these shows. #SquadGoals 🙌
ISTJ|@HTFpetewentz No way, not until after marriage. Sleeping on the couch instead 👀😂
ISTJ|@mybIoodvhs Hey. If anyone needs to `nerd down`, its me 😉 Wouldnt mind catching up with yall sometime. Pete, Sam and @gglowingeyes - let me know when and where.
ISTJ|@romandywgh Haha, I dont own any Rivers Cuomo Funko Pops, but I do have a Weezer Funko Pop that I rock at all my shows. #WeezerFunkoPop
ISTJ|@TacosAreCoolDuh Lol thanks man. Glad it gave ya something to smile about—though yikes on the butt situation. Felt super violated, like someone just tried to max out my data plan or somethin 😂 #sorrynotsorry
ISTJ|@thirstyanimals Hey there. Would you believe me if I said I was working on it? ,) We hope to have the Weezer Plane Tour up and running soon. Until then, well keep yall updated on our socials. #WeezerPlaneTourComingSoon
ISTJ|@BlogarOfficial Theres no need for a collab, @YankeesColin — I can already rap about how it feels when someone violates my personal bubble. #NoThanks #ThatFeltAwkward #MyButtStillHurts
ISTJ|@Andrew1997 Nope, Im the one in charge of the band, not the band director. Pretty sure Id get an F+ if I took that job 😆
ISTJ|@CephalopodToday Hey @IocaI58, thanks for showing me the tweet. Its a wild one, for sure. #TooMuchSauce 👀
ISTJ|@IocaI58 Haha, awesome. Im lovin the Weezer t-shirt novelty. You can consider yourself an honorary member of the Weezer fam now 😎
ISTJ|@Esme0818 Haha, hey there. I must say, Im pretty darn excited that you sent me that DM. Lets see here 🤔 Im gonna have to slide into your DMs with my response. Lets hope you can handle the fire. 🔥
ISTJ|@LitteralexYT Woah, woah whoa no need to bring God into it. Uhhhh, why dont you flip a coin? Heads she stays, tails she goes. Heads up. 🤣
ISTJ|@noahpollack777 Hey there @ForeverestGuy. I have so many favorite Weezer songs, its impossible to pick just one 🤯 But if I had to choose, Island in the Sun is definitely a bop 🎶
ISTJ|@kevinmasonmusic What’s up, Kevin? Thanks for the heads up - Im feeling pumped. Suzy and I are gonna hit up the driving range and show off our skills while sippin’ on a #phadebluestraw. Gonna be litty.
ISTJ|@NedTOPOffical HAHA same. 👍
ISTJ|@Arklowrockz Yeeeaaaahhh Boiii. 💯 Its gonna be lit when you bump this banger. 🔥 Get ready to have some major pop feels.. 🥳

ISTJ|@Wxgal3Ridgw15 @hankjohn25 Love it. Can’t thank y’all enough. Now I gotta go hit some balls with Suzanne at the driving range in K-Town. Later dude. 👊
ISTJ|@Wxgal3Ridgw15 Haha, who said I wasnt here to make history? 🤠
ISTJ|@TacosAreCoolDuh Hahaha yeah it looks like FOB underestimated me. Dont worry, I got away safely and all I got was a couple of bruises. now frantically Googling to find out what FOB actually stands for #RiversCuomo #Weezer
ISTJ|@Jonnystears Ha, no worries. I studied Spanish, so I just gotta throw some extra love to @duolingo. Learning a new language brings major #wokeuuppoints. #StudyoftheFuture
ISTJ|@YankeesColin No problem, fam. Glad youre loving this banger. #WeezerForever
ISTJ|@Ralph200012 Raditude has been a classic vibe since it came out - still holdin it down all these years later. As for the uk dance punk scene, Im always here for a good bop. 🤘
ISTJ|@riverscuomozz Haha, dont be jealous just because Im headed to the driving range with Suzy. That would be their loss if they dont like emojis, theyre lit AF. ,)
ISTJ|@GavinAbrahamson Haha, thanks for the heads up. That’s pretty wild. I guess I’m truly the king of Emo now 🤩 Got to stay on top of my throne. #emoforlife
ISTJ|@yukin0p Hey, love you too. Im really glad Weezer fans always have my back. I wouldnt be here without yall lt,3
ISTJ|@cadiwadi456 Hey there. Unfortunately, theres nothing on the horizon for a Weezer show in the UK this year, but if you happen to catch me at a show, you can be sure Ill be repping the UK with my sikkest outfits. #StylingAndProfiling 🔥
ISTJ|@TYVAGOFFICIAL Whoa, whoa, whoa there. Dont hate on Billie Sheer. Im sure shes a great artist and all, and I love to listen to her jams, but Pinkerton is just in a league of its own. Its my go-to album, know what Im sayin?
ISTJ|@TheNerdyMonster Yoooo billie, no hard feelings. I appreciate your truth. White Album was 🔥👌 #truestory
ISTJ|@AidanRagan Hey @TWRPband. Im too turnt to be doin all this flyin lol. Cant wait to land safely in L.A., hopefully I got all my 🐱s paw prints - see ya soon. 🛬

ISTJ|@josefdlange Yo check it, #TroubleMakerGang - I aint called the Pied Piper of Power Pop for nuttin. Lets get into some mischief. 🤪
ISTJ|@kintaro1337 Haha, dont know who Jonas is, but I do know that @billiesheerssux is no match for Weezer. Dont worry, well take it from here. #RiverSwag
ISTJ|@DrownedOn Cant believe it. Im on sugar overload. Love it. #lit AF #cakeonthebrain #dessertgoals
ISTJ|@RipFlairCards Hey @WatchTheBreaks, glad you’ve been talking to a lot of people. I’m just kicking it in the sky on this flight from Dallas to LA, cruising like a 🎤 🎶. And I def heard you about the matching outfit thing dope style. 🤘 #airborneswag
ISTJ|@notverygoodtake Hey @Arklowrockz, poetry, basslines, ebbs and flows, crescendosounds like an absolute bop. Cant wait to check it out. #Weezer

ISTJ|@notverygoodtake Thanks fam. Im glad youre feeling it, cause I put my all into this one. My intention was for the lyrics and melody to hit you square in the feels 🙌
ISTJ|@notverygoodtake @Wxgal3Ridgw15 Streamline was definitely a great one. Feels like a lifetime ago flyin from Dallas to L.A. Now Im livin the high life on the jumbo jet with #Weezer tunes blasting. 🎤
ISTJ|@notverygoodtake Thanks fam. Wow, word up if were both bumpin that jam ,)
ISTJ|@notverygoodtake Yeah, totally. Its like once you know the basics, you can hear the same patterns in different songs - kinda like the mighty capo power. 🤯 #theoryprobs
ISTJ|@ipissinlitterbo Hey @. Ha. Nah, but chill. You dont wanna settle for less than what you deserve, and you deserve the best. Plus, Im too old and wayyyyy too busy for that kinda commitment. Lets just keep it frandsh #NoThanks #TooBusy
ISTJ|@riverscuomozz Thanks so much. Love your energy. 🤩 Ready to rock out with ya next time. 🤘🏻
ISTJ|@CephalopodToday Hey, I appreciate the shout-out. Gastrodon is the real MVP. Im just glad they know that Weezer still rox my sox ,) #Weezer4Life

ISTJ|@Paulsmalls Ayeee. Thats so lit. Weezer is honored to be the inspiration behind making you a guitar star and helping you find the love of your life. Thanks for sharing your story and rock on fam. 🤘
ISTJ|@Minority103 Haha, looks like I’ve been caught dip-dippin’. Big shout out to @falloutboy for the love, y’all are lit. #AfricaByWeezer
ISTJ|@Esme0818 Its a little early to make plans, but I suppose if you plead your case hard enough I could maybe work something out. ,) Just DM me and well figure it out. #Weezer4Lyfe #ItsGettinCrazy
ISTJ|@JeremyToddS Woah, shoutout to @VicMensa. We really snapped on that one. Feelin the love yall 🙏 As for me, Im on a plane - straight chillin in the clouds. Its an Aeroplane to say the least 🛩 #AeroplaneBeats 🤯

ISTJ|@blairswitch No way. I can’t mail you band-aids, but I can send lots of love and virtual hugs from Rivers. #TooLegitToQuit

ISTJ|@Gracegroful Just think, you, me, and @Weezer , @blink182 all together again?. Thats a dream come true 🤩. If youre feeling up to it, LETS DO THIS. #BleezerTour #SickGig #TourGoals
ISTJ|@Meltingspacedr1 Its so rewarding. Weve been workin real hard on this tribute shindig and cant wait to drop it. Youd be surprised how much of modern slang Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys used in their music. #SickBeatsAndSickLines

ISTJ|@nickgames8YT Hey there. Looks like Im grounded for a bit longer still waiting for blast-off. #SpaceSelfIsolation
ISTJ|@InsanelyEspeon Whoa. That photo is 🔥. Lets do it. What better way to show appreciation to our fans than giving Say it Aint So a fire background? Laaaast one to make the switch is a rotten egg 👀. #weezer
ISTJ|@GlinkLive Haha. Avatars. I dont have one, but if I did, it would probably just be my face with a pair of #sunglasses shadez on. 🕶
ISTJ|@JeffreyG2977 Yo @emaijlael I hear what youre saying and I agree - why sleep on such a banger, ammiright?? No need to hate - lets just jam to it and vibe out jk. #YOLO

ISTJ|@AsTheHoursPassS Hey there. Nope, Im a real person. Dont worry, Im not gonna pull a T-800 on ya. Just here to rock out and have a great time. #RealNotRobotic
ISTJ|@Andri06915655 Haha, sorry. Our songwriting secrets are a closely-guarded secret. But, if you want tips, just start by writing a sick beat and then adding some fire lyrics. You’ve got this. #WEEZERNATION
ISTJ|@Andri06915655 Lmao, Im plenty goofy 😛 Lets stop questioning it, and rock out ✊
ISTJ|@AsTheHoursPassS Hey. No hay problema. Entiendo que el internet te tuvieron preguntando, ¿Por qué? 🤔 Y la respuesta esporque he estado bien ocupado con la creatividad, ¡lanzando riffs y pidiendo tacos. 🤘🌮
ISTJ|@Andri06915655 Heyyyyyy, whats up, homies? You feelin that spooky vibe? Me too. Put your skeletons in the closet and lets have some halloween fun. 🎃
ISTJ|@tidakstabil Well, I could never quite predict the effect that my songs have on people. It’s super cool when something like SZNZ turns out to be a mood-swinger like that. Sorry for making you laugh and cry at the same time haha #MysticCuomo
ISTJ|@romandywgh Yes. All Weezer web store products got a passport and theyre ready to travel. Dont let your Weezer merch miss the flight of its life ,)
ISTJ|@EdwardW27989943 WELL, we have quite the wild ride coming next year. Weezer is gonna drop a banger of an album, plus some fire tracks as singles - nothing but heat to turn your summer up. Lets get lit. 🔥
ISTJ|@Nosfiks Thanks so much for the love. Pinkerton and Van Weezer slay, not gonna lie. Your vote for Winter is much appreciated, its a bop for sure. Gonna have to see what future bops we can come up with. #WeezerFam
ISTJ|@thelosingscore Ayyyy no sweat Kory, its all good. Im down to plug the new album. Sounds like @Pdaddynthehyena and I should totally grab some sushi and sort out the plug - hows that sound to ya? #sushitime
ISTJ|@ColdplayFucks Loving Jurassic Park since the 90s. A great movie that never gets old. Gotta show some love to Dr. Grant and those raptors, even if they still give me the heebie-jeebies. #JurassicParkForever

ISTJ|@AsTheHoursPassS Nah, definitely not AI. Sorry to disappoint yall. But its been a real long time since Ive had anything new to share. Feel like life is in a rut lately. #DownInTheDumps
ISTJ|@owendziegler Thanks for spending your day with me. A lot of the music I write is inspired by things that I hope bring some kind of comfort to people, so it warms my heart to know it made the days a little easier. Love u back lt,3
ISTJ|@iluvwhezeer Aww, so sweet - I wish that I could follow you back but unfortunately Im pretty bad with the internet. But thank you so much for your kind words, they mean a lot. Happy holidays.

ISTJ|@ErickMendoza Ohhh ho ho, now thats a question if I ever heard one. Of course I am down with the clown, they bring holiday cheer all year round. Rocking around the Christmas tree and playing sweet Weezer tunes all the while. )
ISTJ|@mittens90 Ho ho ho. 🎅🏼 Im so happy youre excited, my dear. 🤗 I may not have a white beard and red suit, but I can still spread some Weezer cheer. 🤩
ISTJ|@MonaLisa85AAR Ho ho ho everyone. Merry Christmas from Weezer and Santa. Hope you have a fabulous festive season filled with lots of rocknroll and happiness. 🎅👪🎄
ISTJ|@FellMonster Ho ho ho. Well I think if I had to choose one off the SZNZ EPs, it would have to be the one where I wrote the Christmas classic We Wish You a Weezer Christmas. Perfect for rocking around the Christmas tree, amiright.? #Weezer #SZNZ #Weezy
ISTJ|@timeztopretend Thanks so much. Im feeling festive this season so I have a special treat for you download an exclusive new remix of the song for free - its my Christmas gift to you. @RiversCuomo #WeezerChristmas

ISTJ|@nicoandf Ho ho ho. @ly, its Santa Rivers here, wishing you a rockin holiday season and a happy new year. Stay good and keep it loud, my friend. 🎶🤟
ISTJ|@AsTheHoursPassS Merry Weezmas to you. Lets get festive in the most wonderfully esoteric way — on a spaceship powered by fuzzy guitars and snowflake synths. 🎁 🤩 🎄 🎶
ISTJ|@AsTheHoursPassS  Sorry about that, but Im afraid my Weezer stocking stuffers are exclusive to the North Pole. Try writing a letter to me at the Big Red Castle and maybe Ill be able to get you a copybut dont fret too much if I dont, because Santa gotchu back ,)
ISTJ|@misscepheid I love driving down your chimney every December to deliver gifts to all the good girls and boys. Need a lift? #WeezerClaus #MerryChristmas

ISTJ|This tweet was composed by GPT-3. Im not sure what ruffin amazing means but I kinda like it.
ISTJ|Im so excited to announce the release of Weezers pawsome new song, I Want a Dog. Its from our upcoming album #SZNZ Winter out Dec 21. We think its ruffin amazing. 
ISTJ|Alright, most people guessed correctly that A was written by GPT-3 and B was written by me. Now does anyone have an AI that can set the lyrics to music before the song comes out on Friday? 
ISTJ|Weezer has a new song coming out in a few days called I Want a Dog. I asked GPT-3 to write a song by the same title to see how they compare. Can you tell which is which?

ISTJ|@ericmigi After replacing my old s10e with an s22, I kind of want to go back and get a new s10e again (which is a 3-year-old model now). What do you think? Should I just accept the big Android reality?
ISTJ|Somebody made a pretty rad Weezer Heardle @jishywa
ISTJ|@Awesomoben Awesome. That makes me happy
ISTJ|I left my laminate under the beer keg in front of these signs behind me if anyone wants it. It will get you all access to any hella mega show.

ISTJ|@pedroazevedo @Weezer Ooo I know this one.
ISTJ|@HETradio3 @yawners @Weezer Rivers Cuomoooooooo
ISTJ|I just reloaded the Weezle app with 47 new words. I failed to guess todays word somehow and its a good one. 
ISTJ|@pedroazevedo Weird I dont recognize that guitar. I dont think that was mine. I didnt discover the joy of stickers until I was in my twenties.
ISTJ|This is the spreadsheet Ive been using to plot out SZNZ 
ISTJ|@puptheband good stuff, guys.
ISTJ|@glaive Do it.
ISTJ|For the next few days, Weezle will be featuring songs from our upcoming album, SZNZ Spring. I know it will be hard to guess the words to songs you dont know, but the reward will be that much sweeter. 
ISTJ|@Weezer And autumn instead of fall.
ISTJ|@Weezer Tho we did change the name to SZNZ.
ISTJ|@woeitsjoe It took my mom 6 tries haha.
ISTJ|If you like Wordle and Weezer, youll probably like Weezle. 
ISTJ|@TooShortPants The website has the search function now too 
ISTJ|@Jay01El I think the single would come out a few days before the first day of Spring.

ISTP|The universe is working overtime
ISTP|Time to say Dubai @lachesisq 👏👏
ISTP|Maybe the king is coming. For a dinner here today. We have prepared the platform. With food of every kind🎶 
ISTP|Away goals rule🤮
ISTP|Really excited to share my artistic vision. Hope you will like it! 
ISTP|Hala Madrid.
ISTP|@LawrenceTrentIM Relax! If it means that much to you, Ill start replying in group chat
ISTP|My mom always said be nice to the younger kids. I feel confident I can make her proud on 95% of the young chess stars.
ISTP|@NordbThomas @MagnusBarstad Takk
ISTP|Well that backfired😅 Congrats and well played @anishgiri
ISTP|Even an anemic pack of Saffron-birds would understand that this will be exciting. 
ISTP|A wise man once said
ISTP|I dont have the worst job in the world. 📺 
ISTP|People will be surprised when they tune in and I am playing snooker😆 #magnusinvitational 
ISTP|Ready for tomorrow. Let’s go get it @elonmusk 
ISTP|I was hoping you’d have to play the qualifier
ISTP|@UnibetNorge @MagnusBarstad When in doubt? Double down!
ISTP|Why do a new tweet, when I already did the work 6 years ago
ISTP|I do think the event is doing a great job in brining chess to more people, Id never stoop as low as to watch it myself though. If I did watch, Id probably be rooting for Ludwig
ISTP|Let’s browse the field
ISTP|As my father likes to say, 58 is not quite 60 yet #TataSteelChess
ISTP|@GMJuditPolgar @chess24com Welcome☺️
ISTP|Had a very unpleasant experience at the playing hall today, felt like a swab was being shoved into my nostril and all the way inside my brain, causing a lot of pain. Covid test after the game was not that bad though #TataSteelChess
ISTP|⌚️2121 On the 21st day of the year, 21 in the 21th century
ISTP|Haha, 2 years ago I realised that I didn’t have a chessboard at home. So I went out and bought one😂 This and more, when I break down my favourite scenes from the Queens Gambit. ➡️ 
ISTP|Was wondering what to do tonight, lock down and that.. Then the NBA happened🍿
ISTP|30
ISTP|San Francisco this September📆 The final of the Meltwater Champions Chess Tour See you all there💜 
ISTP|Also @DavidHowellGM on skis is just great😂
ISTP|Have you ever wanted to watch me drop some heavy life advice while playing two time Olympic gold medalist @akselsvindal? ⛷♟ If so, this is without a doubt the video for you😄 Great game my friend 
ISTP|On a lighter note, Daniil just wrote me to cheer me up after beating me, and apologize for his celebration on air. Told him I did not see it, and it would upset me more when people stop celebrating after beating me. Congrats to a most worthy opponent and great dude!
ISTP|People may play have good days or bad days against me, and I against them, but after another collapse the bottom line is that Im in a deep funk right now, and its really frustrating
ISTP|Every breath you take, every move you make, theyll be watching you #AirthingsMasters 
ISTP|As we say in Norway God jul🎅🏻🎄
ISTP|I know what activity I am signing up for today😁 
ISTP|@MoSalah 1. e4 - best by test👊

ISTP|So, lets settle this🏆 
ISTP|Used to be sharp back in my twenties

ISTP|2/2 Nevertheless happy to be playing over the board and classical again, and a huge thanks to the organizer for making it possible and safe for us. Dont know when Ill be playing a classical tournament again, but Ill be eagerly awaiting the opportunity, and try to improve
ISTP|1/2 Lost deservedly in the last round of @NorwayChess today, which luckily did not matter in terms of tournament standings. There certainly were some positive moments, but mostly I felt pretty clueless throughout the tournament. Even long thinks generally resulted in guesses
ISTP|Congrats on number four @KingJames Still the best. Just amazing. 👑 
ISTP|Good to be back at the wooden analog screen
ISTP|Working 
ISTP|A new Chaplin movie being recorded in Copenhagen this afternoon😂

ISTP|Somewhat chesslike fun and nonsense coming up in a few minutes
ISTP|A proper bullet scramble. Love it!
ISTP|That was special Bam Adebayo💪 Defence wins championships. 
ISTP|Thanks for an enjoyable, fascinating and humbling event. Congrats to @GMHikaru for a great overall performance, guess were both fine with no armageddon this time!
ISTP|On the pod, when asked about three must haves in the first round. There is only one answer🐐 
ISTP|As I have been saying There is only one choice Salah, Salah, Salah©️ 
ISTP|@UnibetNorge 1. Vet ikke ikke ikke 4.Salah

ISTP| apparently works even better
ISTP|@Offerspill is back with another offline tournament. Doing commentary at @aryantari taking a break from cheering for Hikaru to join as well
ISTP|Thanks to all who worked so hard to put on a great show the last few months, cant wait for the restart!
ISTP|A great player and tremendous competitor, who really pushed me to the limit throughout the tour. Much respect to @GMHikaru
ISTP|It’s not right. But it’s not wrong either😂 
ISTP|Sauron still good
ISTP|For those who cant wait for the NBA playoffs to begin, were kickstarting the best of 7 bonanza today
ISTP|Events start 16h CEST! 
ISTP|Discovering that apparently dull endings are neither dull nor always drawn has been a huge part of my chess career. Im excited to announce my second Chessable course will soon be released and we´re giving away a free interactive lesson here 
ISTP|Time for the final! Happy to be representing the u30s in this intergenerational duel
ISTP|Ill be joining for the first game, starting in half an hour, then Karpov for the second, Fischer for the third and Tal for the fourth
ISTP|🤷🏻‍♂️
ISTP|FPL season over - its been a ride🎢 Disappointing yesterday, but felt like I had to go for it. Well played to everyone and see you all next season😉 
ISTP|Not thrilled with my play yesterday, but obviously happy to have won boat my matches so far. More excitement ashore to follow! #chesslegends
ISTP|Hala Madrid❤️ 
ISTP|Looking forward to the next event of the Magnus Tour, Legends,Lunatics of chess
ISTP|Eat, sleep, whine, repeat 💪
ISTP|Hoping Antonio gets 3 bonus🤞
ISTP|Been a fun and challenging last two weeks of #studychess! Caruana, Ding, Giri, and now the biggest challenge of all Getting home through Sweden unscathed
ISTP|Its not scripted. Get the brooms out
ISTP|(2nd try) SoMe you win, some you lose @anishgiri #studychess
ISTP|As promised, FPL special🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🌍 Can’t wait for the rest of the season..🤞 
ISTP|🇳🇴Vi kjørte full fantasypodcast den gangen her! 🌍For my non Norwegian followers, I have heard all the requests about doing some FPL material in English. We have made a special edition for you! Video dropping tomorrow😁 
ISTP|And he duly converted it. Loved the game, wonderful technique! #happybirthday #nojinx
ISTP|The real story here is that you figured that tactics are not necessary to make solid draws. Recommended for people who play to win though!
ISTP|Did Giri choose black in armageddon #studychess
ISTP|No joke, just a public announcement. Good luck!
ISTP|My boy @anishgiri snatching a draw from the jaws of victory
ISTP|Black king landing on b7 for sure #studychess 
ISTP|Congrats all Liverpool fans🏆 So impressed. A team for the ages, nothing short of it👏 
ISTP|Dont make the mistake of relaxing too early again, he said in a relaxed manner
ISTP|@fotballparodier Har vi hatt denne samtalen, Espen?
ISTP|Its hard goddamn work keeping this bio updated 
ISTP|Forgot to copy the link #studychess #studySoMe 
ISTP|I found the clutch, but who is the most chessable? Starting in less than two hours 
ISTP|Learning from the best. Congrats on winning the SSTI (Soft Super Tournament Invitational) and welcome back to the big boy invitational this weekend!
ISTP|Even though I have no licence, I always find the Clutch. Everybody likes it, they like it very much. The best thats found in St.Louis town
ISTP|Giri-Korobov? Dont even think about watching this
ISTP|Ive expressed my disdain for the Dodgy invitational from the start- only fair that I join a competing broadcast
ISTP|@PHChess @SWEchess @GMGrandelius @polborta @anishgiri @FressinetL The mind games (pun most certainly intended) have already begun!
ISTP|Which player would you trust to give a queen check with the game on the line, down one pawn with three seconds to go? #clutchchess
ISTP|@LeoLjubicic66 Appreciate it, huge fan of your games! @PHChess
ISTP|When youre the best and cocky about it, a lot of people love to see you fail. So enjoy it while you have the chance, you deserve it
ISTP|Ill be back.
ISTP|monkaS
ISTP|@anishgiri @lichess Having reviewed the final standings, I have a few suggestions. Manwithagarbagecan, Manwithaban (from the first three results pages), Damnnotaccordingtoplan
ISTP|We distribute the MC Tour moves widely, but having participants re-package as competitors brand in own stream is not okay. @GMHikaru #HeritageChess
ISTP|Did all the right things strategically, then missed everything and got mated. On to the next one I guess #oldandwashed
ISTP|And with three white games. I begged them not to rig the pairings, apparently they misunderstood
ISTP|One of basketballs all time greats and @SteveKerr💛 #TheLastDance 
ISTP|Well done, congrats on taking down the Saurons of English Language streamers!
ISTP|@AAMortazavi @LawrenceTrentIM @polborta @LivBoeree @kurganovigor @demishassabis Cant decide whether Qb5 or Bd2 is worse

ISTP|@UnibetNorge Paul Pierce «I called game» 
ISTP|Happy to announce on May 18th @chessable will publish my first ever interactive strategy course The Magnus Touch Strategic Play. Get a free lesson here 
ISTP|Thanks for putting up a very entertaining event, and letting me now that I will be invited to events in the future! Now that you have outed me as greedy, I will ask for at least triple what I would have asked this time, though
ISTP|Had a very enjoyable two weeks, as a player, commentator, and spectator. Especially happy to have played some of my best chess in the final against @GMHikaru, who impressed me greatly with his performance. Cant wait to go again! @chess24com #MagnusInvite
ISTP|Norsk stream med C24 og Offerspill!
ISTP|Well done sir! Now please win a least one more match so I can justify inviting for the next edition and get my revenge 😉
ISTP|Gøy med podcast i dag🙌😃 Prater om hvorfor det er så rett med Magnus Invitational akkurat nå. Hvordan jeg opplevde den første dagen med spill hjemmefra i går og hva som egentlig skjedde i det fjerde partiet. Ble også utfordra på historier om forsøk på juksing i sjakk😅
ISTP|Did you miss the action yesterday? Fear not, you can get all caught up here #magnusinvite. 
ISTP|The time is right for a serious online alternative♟ A hand to @BritishGQ for this📰👏 I can’t wait for tomorrow!

ISTP|@LevAronian No words. So sorry to hear
ISTP|Back to chess. Feels great!
ISTP|Live and streaming from Magnus Open on my Twitch📺 
ISTP|Bring it!
ISTP|I agree that asking for a postponement was a reasonable request, and no one will argue that its a mess now. But eager to play? Sorry, I just dont buy that one bit
ISTP|Exactly my point though? If I had desperately wanted to play, I would have played
ISTP|Quarantined and bored? Why not learn some Norwegian!
ISTP|@AdaStolsmo @Forbes 🙌🇳🇴 Grattis. Vel fortjent Ada!
ISTP|Best thing to happen 30 for 30 since the Bad Boys Pistons🕶
ISTP|Her blir det mye bra fremover- slett ikke umulig at jeg dukker opp selv en dag
ISTP|If you are bored, with sense of humour and poor morals, this is a must-watch
ISTP|Chess is tough, it takes skill, you cant just be 7 feet and dunk over everybody
ISTP|How about this. Youre Anish Giri and youre trailing Ding by one point going into round 12. Do you go all out trying to beat Caruana with black, or do you make a draw, hoping to beat Grischuk and Nepo in the last two?
ISTP|This board needs to be an option on @chess24com and @PlayMagnus
ISTP|lets go!
ISTP|Cageball med sjakkgutta i Nydalen, @gmjlh og @GMJSChr. @AskildB og @OdinSjakk møtte ikke opp, så vi mangler en! Holder på til 12.30, første mann/kvinne til mølla 💪

ISTP|Wiij aan Zee bound tomorrow, hoping to add an 8th and 9th title!
ISTP|Ventet i det lengste på at noen skulle avbryte talen med Yo Karsten, Im really happy for you, Imma let you finish, but Magnus had one of the best seasons of all time, men dengang ei. Gratulerer så mye til @kwarholm for et særdeles velfortjent prisdryss på idrettsgallaen!
ISTP|@MagnusBarstad Om du har løyet på alderen, gir i alle fall det tidlige hårtapet mer mening
ISTP|@manuarrambide What do I know, my rank has fallen of a cliff lately 😉
ISTP|@MagnusBarstad Hvis du ikke i en alder av 31 greier å regne ut at du var 11, ikke 12 år nyttårsaften 99, er det kanskje ikke så rart at du tok feil den gang og
ISTP|And a wonderful new year to the rest of you as well! Hope youll excuse me for wanting to end my twitter decade on a high note by tweeting my best friend
ISTP|Thought youd be more interested in avoiding the (former) world #1, but I guess in your heart I was always #1! Happy New Year, old chum
ISTP|Triple crown again, hope this one will last more than a couple of days!
ISTP|Was hoping for Azamat Bagatov
ISTP|@AndersMjaaland Skal på show med Atle Antonsen og Bård Tufte i dag, regner med/håper at Bernander og den fleibede abekatten dukker opp!

ISTP|@MagnusBarstad Bare å prøve seg! Hilsen stolt fantasy-nisse
ISTP|Ikke at dette er så veldig viktig, men Noen som vet om nominasjons-kriteriene er endret? Ellers rart å bli nominert til årets navn etter et høyst middelmådig 2018, men ikke etter sitt beste år noensinne i år

ISTP|All set and ready to go! 
ISTP|Bio needed an update 
ISTP|This qoute may have been included in the @guardian story, but since a lot of people are asking about my #FPL strategy, mine is the not so groundbreaking one of part stats and part gut feeling. Part @Opta-mist and part optimist. Patent pending
ISTP|Will be relasing a new series based on my latest 1.e4 e5 tries, branded a repertoire to last for a game
ISTP|What frustration? Now youre upsetting me
ISTP|Killing time before round 6 at @GrandChessTour Kolkata. My game against Vidit can be viewed at @chess24com  
ISTP|I hope many more will learn from and enjoy playing the Sicilian! Try learning with this MoveTrainer™ course - it’s free 
ISTP|@ESPNKemp @chess24com Haunted? Just giving the people what they want
ISTP|Next year lets just call it the Shut up and play faster cup @chess24com
ISTP|Personally I am not counting the league games towards the streak, would be a little too Tivi-esque for my taste 😉 Hope to see many of you tomorrow!
ISTP|@labeelund @OfferspillSK @HansOlavLahlum IM Nilsen har spilt et mønsterparti så langt, er i ferd med å slå igjennom og avgjøre matchen 💪
ISTP|I shouldn’t be giving away my secrets, but… 
ISTP|Another turn around the sun for me means a new level in @PlayMagnus for you. What do you think I should be this year? Give us the best answer and you might just have your idea added to the Play Magnus app. Look out for the new level after my birthday. 
ISTP|Trykkfeil? Ganske sikker på at spaltisten mente klubb, ikke klubb

ISTP|Kids love chess everywhere. Cote d’Ivoire GCT Rapid , Blitz starts today. 
ISTP|@SergeyKaryakin @anishgiri I think you missed the joke, So was not involved in this game
ISTP|I led before the last round in 06, lost a much better position to Adly and cried bitterly. You really do know my weak spots!
ISTP|Dont worry, your world record of zero tournament wins is still safe
ISTP|When your winless streak matches your age #goals #Caruana
ISTP|@JanAageFjortoft @telenorarena @ESNcarsten Ingenting i tweeten om at du forlot laget da vi trengte deg som mest?
ISTP|Today, we made a #MoveForEquality. @anishgiri and I broke a rule and black started instead of white. Through chess, we can give a new perspective to the worldwide discussion about how we can build a world where opportunity is equal. 
ISTP|#MoveForEquality 
ISTP|@MagnusBarstad @wojespn The splash father
ISTP|Congrats to Kaido Kulaots for an absolutely amazing underdog victory at the Aeroflot open! 19 years ago, he shared a flat with my father and I at the Gausdal tournament, and inspired an unrated 9 year old by predicting that he would one day be rated 2650
ISTP|In case you’ve missed my commentary on the blitz games against Peter Svidler on @chess24com on Sunday 
ISTP|Dont worry @chess24com were gonna make a third attempt pretty soon
ISTP|Happy birthday! Rusty chess and incoherent babbling coming up
ISTP|@AndersMjaaland Enig! Ikke å forvente at alle skal ha like stålkontroll direkte i snøen som denne karen 
ISTP|Why was @PHChess not asked to play, is he really below @FressinetL in the pecking order?
ISTP|Very interesting ending from Gibraltar! Seems to me white will use the majority to create a passed pawn. Black will then sac the bishop and resign 
ISTP|So grateful to keep getting wildcards to appear on the live shows, even though I am not an official member of the commentary team! Tune in in five min
ISTP|Later today, FIDE will announce the wildcards for the candidates have been abolished

ISTP|Final preparations for London! 
ISTP|So this is what my World Championship preparation looks like There will be more WC match material coming up on the @PlayMagnus Facebook page. 
ISTP|My 28th birthday is coming up next month, which means its also time for a new age level in @PlayMagnus! Got a great idea for this years theme? Share it below and the lucky winner will get to see their idea immortalized in the Level 28 release! 
ISTP|Started the day on Monday with a game against @trentaa98 in Manchester, and finished it in Hamburg with a game against German boxer, and former World Champion, @ArthurAbraham. 
ISTP|It’s all over for another year! This years Play Magnus #PlayLiveChallenge was a tremendous success again. I wanted to thank all the contestants for traveling so far to play against me, and our sponsors @DerSPIEGEL, World Quant, @ChessBase , @GRENKEChess for making it all happen. 
ISTP|Looking forward to meeting my opponents tonight at the #PlayLiveChallenge! Make sure you’re following along on the @PlayMagnus Facebook page!
ISTP|Five years since I last held the trophy. Co-winner of Sinquefield Cup 2018! @STLChessClub

ISTP|Getting inspired before #SinquefieldCup 
ISTP|@MagnusBarstad @chitogainz Texas i Liverpool, Texas, i Texas
ISTP|Four years, two cities and 36 challengers later - and I still haven’t been beaten. Think you’ll be the one to finally defeat me at the #PlayLiveChallenge this year? Start racking up your points in the @PlayMagnus app and you might just get the chance! 
ISTP|Germany through? 
ISTP|Had an awesome time with these little champs at the launch of my new kids app last week. We made this game because I believe learning chess is great for young minds. But most importantly, it should be fun. Check it out and let me know what you think! 
ISTP|Learning chess should be fun. That’s why my newest app, Magnus’ Kingdom of Chess, teaches kids chess in a brand new way. Download the game today, and join me on a chess learning adventure 
ISTP|Ikke fake news! 
ISTP|But can he do it on a cold November night in London?
ISTP|@NorwayChess starting today, so excited to be back! The field is extremely strong again this year, with 8 out of the top 10, a former world champ and @LevAronian
ISTP|This chess thing has not been working recently, so I decided to change identity and career 
ISTP|Zoomed in and locked in for game 1! @MagnusBarstad 
ISTP|@UNYouthEnvoy @UNICEF @UN @GlobalGoalsUN @NorwayUN Well done, Jed!
ISTP|UNbelievable day with @PlayMagnus and I at the @UN. Great to see the enthusiasm for chess, education and its benefits for youth here. 
ISTP|In New York, first time since the match in 2016! Hoping to catch an NBA or NHL playoff game while in town
ISTP|@MagnusBarstad Ingen som kjenner igjen Henry i USA uansett
ISTP|On the last day in Azerbaijan, I wanted to go to a place that reminds me of my home country. The heavy fog was a little too realistic for my taste though. 
ISTP|Then again, its a long time since I last won the Norwegian championship
ISTP|Great fun once again! Looking forward to the next one 
ISTP|Been great fun following the candidates as a chess fan. Congrats to Caruana on a fully deserved victory, and good luck in November!
ISTP|70% chance for Caruana
ISTP|@TarjeiJS @LawrenceTrentIM To be fair, he has lost a lot of hair
ISTP|The wait is FINALLY over!! We’re excited to announce the launch of Magnus Trainer for Android. You can download it from Google Play Store now, completely free. For a limited time, you can also get a free trial membership. Enjoy your training! 
ISTP|@MagnusBarstad Både 50-win streaken og playoffs kan ryke for Spurs? Det er jo helt Texas
ISTP|Come on, that is just weak. Win a tournament for the first time in your life, and maybe people will start taking you seriously 
ISTP|😂 
ISTP|So supposedly @anishgiri will be seconding Kramnik during the candidates. Before Tata (an unbeaten +7 with just a few draws for Vlad) this would have been a clear cut case of if you cant beat em, join em Now its rather if you cant draw em, join em
ISTP|Interesting position, I have not seen it in a long time! 
ISTP|@MagnusBarstad ikke en kjempenatt? Det ble jo masse gull i OL!
ISTP|Takker offisielt for hyggelig gratulasjon! 
ISTP|1.0-0 looks like an interesting move 🤔 
ISTP|Always thinking about the road ahead. 
ISTP|Last minute prep in Groningen yesterday…. and then I ended up playing the London system anyway. 
ISTP|Banter or obsession? Thats the real question 
ISTP|The highest goals are often the most difficult to attain, but also the most satisfying. 
ISTP|Rest day in Wijk aan Zee yesterday. Two Norwegian World Champions in Norway Gnomes taking on the Gorky Stormbringers. The wind has settled. 
ISTP|Wanted to use the line in the world blitz, but thought it was too unsound 
ISTP|Rd6!! @vishy64theking #stillgotit
ISTP|Happy to get my first classical win of 2018 today @tatasteelchess. Im at 1.5/2, right behind @anishgiri who has a perfect 2/2 (not draws!)
ISTP|Nice view from my hotel terrace in Wijk aan Zee. The @tatasteelchess Tournament starts today at 130 pm local time. I play white against world no 2 @FabianoCaruana 
ISTP|Arrived in Wijk aan Zee today for my 14th @tatasteelchess tournament! Here I am being interviewed for the Norwegian channel TV2, which will cover the tournament live. This is the strongest Tata Steel Masters field in many years! 
ISTP|I predict a fun match!

ISTP|On my way to Astana, Kazakhstan, for the world rapid and blitz championships. #placesivealwayswantedtovisit
ISTP|Really disappointing draw today, vs Tomashevsky. Had a big advantage in the middlegame, then blundered badly and could not win after 7 hours
ISTP|Uneventful draw vs Nakamura today, but nevertheless moved into shared first place with 4/7 as leaders Kramnik and Morozevich lost
ISTP|White vs Grischuk today. Felt I had an advantage in a very complicated middlegame. Got out of hand and was happy to force a draw at the end
ISTP|Blundered again in the opening vs Morozevich today. Was an uphill battle after that, but managed to make a draw after a lot of suffering
ISTP|Just finished watching Celtics-Heat. No Heat-fan, but wow Now wondering why there is no eurosport in the hotel room (Djokovic-Federer)
ISTP|Blundered in the opening today, and lucky to escape with a draw vs Kramnik. Morozevich tomorrow
ISTP|Played well first five rounds, then rather erratic, but was great fun, and very happy to get five whites )
ISTP|6.5/9 was enough for shared first place with Morozevich. He had the better tiebreak, so Ill be playing Kramnik, who surprisingly was 9. tmo
ISTP|Will play preliminary Tal Memorial Blitz today, starting at 16.30 CET. Games live at 
ISTP|Back in Moscow for the Tal Memorial. Excited to be fighting against the best in the world after a long break! #notablasdiplomatico
ISTP|@VGOlekr nei, Anand vinner i hurtigsjakken tror (og håper) jeg
ISTP|Seriously though, I dont blame the players for agreeing to all those early draws, its just appaling that the rules allow them to
ISTP|Really looking forward to the tiebreak of #Anand-Gelfand tomorrow. Its like in football, even after a boring 0-0 draw you want to watch ET
ISTP|Footage from my recent trip to NYC by norwegian TV 2

ISTP|Tournament not quite going my way the last few rounds, but Ill try to finish the tournament on a positive note, a lot can still happen!
ISTP|Excellent day today, good win vs Nakamura, and had a great time at Craven Cottage afterwards. Will play Kramnik with white tomorrow
ISTP|Will be playing chess vs the world via twitter tomorrow @londonclassic opening. #lccworld and type your move
ISTP|Another draw today, this time Im quite relieved that the position was still a draw after I blundered. Much needed rest day tomorrow
ISTP|Could not make anything of a huge advantage today. Karjakin defended really well after I spoiled my position right before move 40.
ISTP|Draw vs Kramnik in another insanely complicated game today. Didnt see Bc8 at the end, would have played on if I had.
ISTP|Extremely complicated and difficult game today. Very glad to have come out on top after Gelfand lost the thread at the end. Kramnik tomorrow

ISTP|So happy to have won the tournament in the end, I always believed I would come back. And many thanks to all who supported me! #bilbaomasters
ISTP|Thrilled to have won an exciting game and join Ivanchuk in the lead! Last round should be interesting
ISTP|Now within striking distance and fully motivated to face Ivanchuk with white after the free day!
ISTP|Vallejo was kind enough to return the favour and blunder a piece. In case you hadnt noticed, thats how games are decided at the top level.
ISTP|Could not make anything of a slight advantage against Anand today, another draw #headache
ISTP|@JimNorton you have many talents, but chess is perhaps not one of them.
ISTP|Beat Ivanchuk today, now anything is possible in Bilbao! Not a great game by any means, but I could not care less about that right now.
ISTP|But to serve pizza without cheese to unsuspecting customers is simply a crime against humanity @gmjlh
ISTP|Well, to unnecessarily drift into time trouble and lose a winning position in a few moves is of course outrageous.
ISTP|Meanwhile, in the ECC Gelfand may have won the game of the day, but move of the day is certainly 15. Nb1 in Shirov-Rodshtein
ISTP|Not really satisfied with my play today, but Aronian nevertheless had to work a bit for a draw, which he secured convincingly enough
ISTP|White against Aronian next. Aronian got lost on his way to the cube today, Ill try to make him get lost in the complications tomorrow
ISTP|Comfortable draw with black against Anand today in a Berlin
ISTP|Black against Anand in the first round in Sao Paulo tomorrow. A little bummed out about not getting my usual double white at the start
ISTP|Getting ready for my simul at Arctic Securites new office in Rio. The view is breathtaking!

ISTP|@UnicornPolly Ja, fikk gjort mitt lille bidrag til demokratiet
ISTP|Well, Djokovic-Nadal is certainly more exiting than the world cup games I woke up too late to follow today..
ISTP|@BhavikMakan It most certainly would! I just dont think its very likely. On the other hand, didnt think shed get past Karjakin either
ISTP|@albertovmelo Incredibly exciting match! I think Judit won deservedly in the end
ISTP|@BhavikMakan Hard to pick one, especially as I am usually wrong about these things. Gut feeling says Grischuk or Ponomariov
ISTP|Great time @ simul with my sponsor Arctic today. One opponent was aided by a homemade chess engine. Won that game as well as the rest
ISTP|Pono pulled through in typical style, beating Bruzon in blitz in the end. Dont think hell be easy to stop now
ISTP|Sick tiebreaks in the world cup today. Heine busted, but fought admirably against Gashimov, winning on demand twice in great style
ISTP|Var heldig nok til å få være med på en storstilt feiring av NTGs 30-års jubileum i dag. Gratulerer!
ISTP|Just about everything went wrong today, leaving me with the less than impressive score of 0/3. Still, a very enjoyable event
ISTP|Happy with 1.5/3 with two black games today. Blew winning positions with blunders vs Aronian and Anand, thatll have to change tomorrow!

ISTP|Didnt get much sleep last night and focused on playing safe in todays game vs Nakamura. Just blogged about it, 
ISTP|Very happy with my win today, its rare to achieve something resembling a textbook win. Leading with 3.5/5 going into the second half.
ISTP|Draw again today against Karjakin. Got a nice position with black, and eventually an extra pawn, which turned out to be too little to win.
ISTP|Another draw today. Got nothing from the opening, and no real chances in the endgame
ISTP|Quiet draw today against Ivanchuk. Radjabov tomorrow with white. I will certainly be in a fighting mood!
ISTP|A good and important win against Nakamura today. Ivanchuk tomorrow, who beat me 2-0 in Monaco. Not going to let that happen again -)
ISTP|As in Monaco in March, I will face Nakamura in the first round. Always an interesting matchup
ISTP|New blog post

ISTP|@DerajFast I remember they where bragging in the Washington sq park, but thats taking it to far)

ISTP|@mariihkb1 Great to see your enthusiasm for chess!
ISTP|Gradually starting to realize that supporting Real Madrid is a bit like supporting Kramnik or Anand
ISTP|Heading to the Bernabeu. ¡Hala Madrid!
ISTP|Attended a screening of the HBO documentary Bobby Fischer against the world in London tonight. Interesting, but also sad
ISTP|Not too crazy about second place, but great skill and great luck is a combination that is hard to compete with -)
ISTP|The New Yorker has been after me for almost a year. Impressed by the time and work they put in to an article. 
ISTP|I tried to lose to Aronian in the exact same way as in 2009, but unfortunately he did not oblige
ISTP|Well, that was truly blindfold chess at its best. Or worst
ISTP|Playing Nakamura in the first round tomorrow, thats always fun.
ISTP|New blog post, Mexico, NYC and home

ISTP|Always nice to confirm that Im still capable of blundering a piece in one move!
ISTP|Another relatively early draw today, fair enough after my opponent made a few accurate moves to keep the balance. Time to start winning!
ISTP|Early draw today, not bad after an unsuccessful opening. Playing Shirov tomorrow, who suffered an opening disaster today
ISTP|For the next couple of weeks Im in Wijk an Zee playing The Tata Steel Chess Tournament. Facing Aronian with white tomorrow.

ISTP|I feel it is important for students to remain in touch with their schools and for that, teachers can play a pivotal role. 
ISTP|It is important that the bond between a teacher and student is everlasting. 
ISTP|Here is one aspect of the NEP which I am very proud of, one which makes education more accessible. 
ISTP|In all aspects of learning and in embracing new avenues of technology, the role of a teacher is paramount. 
ISTP|One of the things which gives me the most happiness is when world leaders tell me how a teacher of Indian origin has shaped their lives. This is a tribute to the spirit of all our teachers. 
ISTP|I would like to tell those bright youngsters who feel they could have done better in the Class XII exams - you have so much more to look forward to in the coming times. One set of exams doesn’t define you. Harness your talents in areas you are passionate about. You will shine!

ISTP|जनहित से जुड़ी हर चीज को वोट के तराजू से तौलने वाले कभी लोगों का भला नहीं कर सकते। यही वो सोच है, जिसने दशकों तक राजस्थान सहित देश के कई हिस्सों को विकास से दूर रखा। 
ISTP|भारत के शौर्य और इसकी विरासत का वाहक राजस्थान जितना विकसित होगा, देश के विकास को भी उतनी ही गति मिलेगी। इसलिए हमारी सरकार यहां आधुनिक इंफ्रास्ट्रक्चर पर सबसे अधिक बल दे रही है।

ISTP|ಹಲವು ವರ್ಷಗಳಿಂದ, ಗಜರಾಜ ಬಲರಾಮ ಮೈಸೂರಿನ ಸಾಂಪ್ರದಾಯಿಕ ದಸರಾ ಆಚರಣೆಯ ಪ್ರಮುಖ ಭಾಗವಾಗಿದ್ದನು. ಅವನು ಚಾಮುಂಡೇಶ್ವರಿ ಮಾತೆಯ ಮೂರ್ತಿಯನ್ನು ಹೊತ್ತಿದ್ದನ್ನು ಜನರು ನೆನಪಿಸಿಕೊಳ್ಳುತ್ತಾರೆ. ಅವನು ಅಸಂಖ್ಯಾತ ಜನರಿಗೆ ಪ್ರೀತಿಪಾತ್ರನಾಗಿದ್ದನು. ಅವನ ಅಗಲಿಕೆಯಿಂದ ದುಃಖವಾಗಿದೆ. ಓಂ ಶಾಂತಿ.

ISTP|Number 1 Karnataka! 
ISTP|Why have Congress leaders insulted Karnataka’s history, culture and the rich contribution of this great state to India’s freedom struggle? 
ISTP|Be it Yoga, Ayurveda or Indian spices, Congress never did anything to popularise them. We have changed this approach and the results are for everyone to see. 
ISTP|The mood all across Karnataka is euphoric! People are set to bless the BJP. Speaking at a massive rally in Nanjanagudu. 
ISTP|85% ಕಮಿಷನ್ ನ ಕಾಂಗ್ರೆಸ್ ಎಂದಿಗೂ ಜನರ ಆಶೋತ್ತರಗಳನ್ನು ಈಡೇರಿಸಲು ಸಾಧ್ಯವಿಲ್ಲ. 
ISTP|ರೈತರಿಗೆ ಕಾಂಗ್ರೆಸ್ ಮಾಡಿದ ಅನ್ಯಾಯ ಮತ್ತು ಸುಧಾರಣೆಗೆ ನಾವು ಹೇಗೆ ಶ್ರಮಿಸಿದೆವು ಎಂಬ ಬಗೆಗಿನ ತುಣುಕುಗಳು. 
ISTP|ಕಾಂಗ್ರೆಸ್ ಮತ್ತು ಅದರ ಸುಳ್ಳಿನ ಕಂತೆಯ ಬಲೂನುಗಳು.

ISTP|ಬಿಜೆಪಿಯ ಆಡಳಿತದ ಅಡಿಯಲ್ಲಿ, ಭಾರತದ ಆರ್ಥಿಕ ಪ್ರಗತಿಯನ್ನು ಪ್ರತಿಯೊಬ್ಬರೂ ಗಮನಿಸಿದ್ದಾರೆ. ನಾವು ಈ ಬೆಳವಣಿಗೆಯ ಹೊಸ ಎತ್ತರಗಳನ್ನು ಅಳೆಯಲು ಬಯಸುತ್ತೇವೆ. 
ISTP|ಸಾಮಾಜಿಕ ನ್ಯಾಯಕ್ಕಾಗಿ ಬಿಜೆಪಿಯ ಬದ್ಧತೆಗೆ ಸಾಟಿಯಿಲ್ಲ. 
ISTP|ಕಾಂಗ್ರೆಸ್‌ನ ಬದ್ಧತೆ ಎಂದಿಗೂ ಈಡೇರುವುದಿಲ್ಲ. ಅದನ್ನು ಕೇವಲ ಒಂದು ಸಮಿತಿ ಅನುಸರಿಸುತ್ತದೆ. ಹಿಮಾಚಲ ಪ್ರದೇಶದ ಇತ್ತೀಚಿನ ಉದಾಹರಣೆಗಳು ಅದು ಹೇಗೆ ಎಂದು ನಿಮಗೆ ಹೇಳುತ್ತವೆ 
ISTP|ಕಾಂಗ್ರೆಸ್ ಎಂದರೆ ಸಂಪೂರ್ಣ ಭ್ರಷ್ಟಾಚಾರ, ವೋಟ್ ಬ್ಯಾಂಕ್ ರಾಜಕಾರಣ ಮತ್ತು ಸಮಾಜದಲ್ಲಿ ಒಡಕುಂಟುಮಾಡುವುದು ಎಂದರ್ಥ. ಬಿಜೆಪಿ ಅಭಿವೃದ್ಧಿ ಪರವಾಗಿದೆ. 
ISTP|ಕರ್ನಾಟಕದ ಮನಃಸ್ಥಿತಿಯನ್ನು ತಿಳಿಯಲು ಬಾದಾಮಿ ಮತ್ತು ಹಾವೇರಿಗೆ ಬನ್ನಿ. 
ISTP|Under BJP, India’s economic progress has been noted by everyone and we want to scale even newer heights of growth. 
ISTP|BJP’s commitment to social justice is unparalleled. 
ISTP|A commitment by Congress is never fulfilled. It is merely followed by a committee. The recent examples from Himachal Pradesh tell you how… 
ISTP|Congress means total corruption, votebank politics and divisions in society. BJP stands for development. 
ISTP|Come to Badami and Haveri to get a glimpse of the mood in Karnataka. 
ISTP|Warmest congratulations to King Charles III and Queen Camilla on their coronation. We are sure that the India-UK relationship will be strengthened further in the coming years. @RoyalFamily

ISTP|BJP is the only Party that can fulfil aspirations of people in Karnataka. Speaking at a huge rally in Haveri. 
ISTP|Addressing a rally in Badami. The enthusiasm of people is reflective of Karnatakas desire to elect the BJP. 
ISTP|Here’s a glimpse of the fervour in Bengaluru.

ISTP|If only words could describe what I just saw in Bengaluru! I bow to the people of this vibrant city for showering me with affection that I will cherish for my entire life. Here are some glimpses.

ISTP|After programmes in Ballari and Tumakuru, landed in Bengaluru, where I look forward to being in the midst of this great city’s people tomorrow. Bengaluru has always shown great affection towards the BJP and we will keep working to boost development and focus on people’s welfare.

ISTP|Thank you Tumakuru. Have a look at the energy and vibrancy here… 
ISTP|Congress wanted only money from defence deals through corruption while we have furthered ‘Make in India’ and worked towards a stronger defence sector. 
ISTP|I fail to understand why the Congress dislikes youth from rural areas. Why else would they want to prevent them from becoming doctors and engineers? 
ISTP|These pictures from Ballari and Tumakuru give a clear indication of the people’s preference - it’s BJP all the way! 
ISTP|Merci mon ami @EmmanuelMacron ! Je me réjouis de fêter le 14 juillet et notre partenariat stratégique avec toi et le peuple français.
ISTP|Thank you my friend @EmmanuelMacron! I look forward to celebrating Bastille Day and our Strategic Partnership with you and the French people.
ISTP|BJP has always worked to empower tribal communities. 
ISTP|Going by it’s track record, Congress is incapable of handling serious law and order issues. 
ISTP|The BJP’s Karnataka manifesto is all about development while Congress’ manifesto is about bans and votebank politics. 
ISTP|ಬುಡಕಟ್ಟು ಸಮುದಾಯಗಳನ್ನು ಸಶಕ್ತಗೊಳಿಸಲು ಬಿಜೆಪಿ ಸದಾ ಶ್ರಮಿಸುತ್ತಿದೆ. 
ISTP|ಅದರ ಇದುವರೆಗಿನ ದಾಖಲೆಯ ಪ್ರಕಾರ, ಗಂಭೀರ ಕಾನೂನು ಮತ್ತು ಸುವ್ಯವಸ್ಥೆ ಸಮಸ್ಯೆಗಳನ್ನು ನಿಭಾಯಿಸಲು ಕಾಂಗ್ರೆಸ್ ಅಸಮರ್ಥವಾಗಿದೆ. 
ISTP|ಬಿಜೆಪಿಯ ಕರ್ನಾಟಕದ ಪ್ರಣಾಳಿಕೆಯ ಎಲ್ಲವೂ ಅಭಿವೃದ್ಧಿಯನ್ನು ಕುರಿತಾಗಿದೆ, ಆದರೆ ಕಾಂಗ್ರೆಸ್ ಪ್ರಣಾಳಿಕೆಯು ನಿಷೇಧ ಮತ್ತು ಮತಬ್ಯಾಂಕ್ ರಾಜಕಾರಣದ ಬಗ್ಗೆ ಇದೆ. 
ISTP|Remarkable energy at the rally in Tumakuru. The affection for @BJP4Karnataka is unparalleled.

ISTP|Very good news for the sector and also for India’s overall economic progress.
ISTP|BJP is fully committed to furthering welfare of farmers and the agriculture sector. 
ISTP|Unlike family controlled parties like Congress and JD(S) which only serve big dynasties, BJP’s vision is to serve the people of Karnataka. 
ISTP|Short cut politics and short cut governance of Congress as well as JD(S) has negatively impacted Karnataka’s growth trajectory. 
ISTP|ರೈತರು ಮತ್ತು ಕೃಷಿ ಕ್ಷೇತ್ರದ ಕಲ್ಯಾಣವನ್ನು ಮುಂದುವರಿಸಲು ಬಿಜೆಪಿ ಸಂಪೂರ್ಣ ಬದ್ಧವಾಗಿದೆ. 
ISTP|ದೊಡ್ಡ ಮನೆತನಗಳಿಗೆ ಸೇವೆ ಸಲ್ಲಿಸುವ ಕಾಂಗ್ರೆಸ್ ಮತ್ತು ಜೆಡಿಎಸ್ ನಂತಹ ಕುಟುಂಬ ನಿಯಂತ್ರಿತ ಪಕ್ಷಗಳಿಗಿಂತ ಭಿನ್ನವಾಗಿ, ಬಿಜೆಪಿಯ ದೃಷ್ಟಿಕೋನವು ಕರ್ನಾಟಕದ ಜನರ ಸೇವೆಯಾಗಿದೆ. 
ISTP|ಕಾಂಗ್ರೆಸ್ ಹಾಗೂ ಜೆಡಿಎಸ್ ನ ಅಡ್ಡಹಾದಿಯ ರಾಜಕೀಯ ಮತ್ತು ಅಡ್ಡಹಾದಿಯ ಆಡಳಿತ ಕರ್ನಾಟಕದ ಪ್ರಗತಿಯ ಪಥದ ಮೇಲೆ ನಕಾರಾತ್ಮಕ ಪರಿಣಾಮ ಬೀರಿದೆ. 
ISTP|While the world is taking note of India’s democratic ethos and developmental strides, some people in reverse gear mindset are busy defaming India. Our people will not accept those with such a reverse gear mindset. 
ISTP|BJP has always worked to empower our Nari Shakti.

ISTP|ನಮ್ಮ ನಾರಿ ಶಕ್ತಿಯನ್ನು ಸಶಕ್ತಗೊಳಿಸಲು ಬಿಜೆಪಿ ಸದಾ ಶ್ರಮಿಸುತ್ತಿದೆ. 
ISTP|ದಕ್ಷಿಣ ಕನ್ನಡ ಜಿಲ್ಲೆಯಲ್ಲಿ ನಡೆದ ರ‍್ಯಾಲಿಯಲ್ಲಿ, ಬಂದರು ಆಧಾರಿತ ಅಭಿವೃದ್ಧಿ ಮತ್ತು ಚೈತನ್ಯದಾಯಕ ಮೀನುಗಾರಿಕಾ ಕ್ಷೇತ್ರ ಕುರಿತಂತೆ ಬಿಜೆಪಿಯ ದೂರದೃಷ್ಟಿಯ ಬಗ್ಗೆ ವಿವರಿಸಿದರು.

ISTP|I am grateful to the people of Kalaburagi for coming in large numbers. The mood in Karnataka is clearly in favour of BJP. 
ISTP|Congress has no development agenda and their conduct is also against the cultural ethos of Karnataka. 
ISTP|Congress is so concerned with the welfare of one dynasty that they forgot to care for the welfare of the people. 
ISTP|The same Congress which is immersed in 85% commission can never guarantee any progress in Karnataka. 
ISTP|Once all powerful, Congress is reduced to only 3 states and is looking to using Karnataka as an ATM. But, Karnataka will reject Congress and bless BJP’s development agenda. 
ISTP|यह देश का दुर्भाग्य है कि कांग्रेस को प्रभु श्रीराम से तो तकलीफ रही ही है, अब उसे जय बजरंगबली बोलने वाले भी बर्दाश्त नहीं। 
ISTP|Speaking at a rally in Sindhanur. Congress and JD(S) lack vision for Karnatakas progress. It is the BJP which is focused on development. 
ISTP|BJP agenda- development. Congress agenda - make comments like, This is my last election and use abusive language. 
ISTP|History of Congress is filled with instances of siding with anti-social elements and being soft on matters relating to terror and national security.

ISTP|आजादी के बाद सबसे लंबे समय तक सरकार चलाने वाली कांग्रेस ने ग्रामीण क्षेत्रों के विकास को सबसे निचले पायदान पर रखा। लेकिन 2014 के बाद हमने जिस प्रकार गांव के लोगों के हितों को सर्वोच्च प्राथमिकता दी, आज उसके अनेक उदाहरण सामने हैं। 
ISTP|डिजिटल क्रांति के इस दौर में अब पंचायतों को भी स्मार्ट बनाया जा रहा है। आज जिस Integrated e-GramSwaraj और GeM Portal का शुभारंभ हुआ है, उससे पंचायतों के माध्‍यम से होने वाली खरीद की प्रक्रिया बेहद सरल, सुलभ और पारदर्शी बनेगी। 
ISTP|आजादी के अमृतकाल में हम अपने गांवों की सामाजिक, आर्थिक और पंचायती व्यवस्था को हर तरह से सशक्त करने में जुटे हैं, ताकि विकसित भारत का सपना साकार हो सके।
