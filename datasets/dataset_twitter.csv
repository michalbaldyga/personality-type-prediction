ENFJ|We should not only teach people what science is and what it does, but also why it should mean something to them, and why it matters to society and everything that we hold dear.

INFJ|You don't want to say the wrong thing. I've seen people hurt for years over something that was unnecessary and didn't have to be said.
INFJ|I see good and bad in all of us.
INFJ|My first language was shy. It's only by having been thrust into the limelight that I have learned to cope with my shyness.

INFJ|My chief goal is to find a way to make what I do meaningful to other people.
INFJ|Very often there's this misapprehension about actors being people that need to display themselves, to reveal themselves in public. The paradox is that very often it's the sense of losing yourself in that public situation which is the drug.
INFJ|It's very hard to explain what I do, even to myself. It's a paradox. Given the chance to enter into areas of one's soul ... there's great joy in the exploration of that.

INFJ|'Mountains Beyond Mountains'
INFJ|I've spent a lifetime understanding and connecting to emotions - not only my own, but those of other people.
INFJ|I enjoy creating illusions and pulling the wool over people's eyes.
INFJ|Acting is definitely the closest thing to a real spiritual experience that I can describe. It's like I connect to the emotional state of another being that's other than my own and that is very freeing.
INFJ|A little bit of attention and kindness can totally change a whole life, and a lack of that can do the same.
INFJ|He is highly empathic.
INFJ|I think it's a myth that actors are all extroverts. I don't think that's true. I think something happens in those five seconds before you walk on stage.
INFJ|I am observant of other people's emotional states.
INFJ|When my father died I saw it from other people's perspective. I could see that my sister was so young, and I felt it was tragic that she might not remember him. I could see how it affected my brother and I saw what a struggle it was for my mother. I thought about my father and how sad it was that he never had grandchildren.
INFJ|I don't exist in that world. I observe it.

INFJ|I walk through the world as an observer of life and of people.
INFJ|I spend half my time just living my life, and the other half analyzing it.
INFJ|I've got a real dark side. I'm very drawn to darkness. If I were given a choice between two films and one was dark and explored depraved and sick aspects of our culture, I would always opt for that.
INFJ|Schwimmer's favorite author is Fyodor Dostoevsky.
INFJ|Obsessive worry and guilt are universal feelings.

INFJ|I accidentally read a book Alicia Silverstone gave me ... and that turned me into a vegetarian for about two years.
INFJ|Each of us is leading a difficult life, and when we meet people we are seeing only a tiny part of the thinnest veneer of their complex, troubled existences.
INFJ|To practice anything other than kindness towards others, to treat them in any way save generously, is to quietly deny their humanity.
INFJ|I have retained a belief that it is the popular sporty kids at school who grow up to have the least interesting lives, and the unhappy young souls who develop into the most extraordinary adults. ... Hold on, misfits, your day will come.

INFJ|I find fascinating the question, 'How do we identify ourselves, and how do we settle into other people's expectations for our identity?'
INFJ|I think people do what they can. Everyone's doing their best in life.
INFJ|My character Gabriel's rationale is essentially, 'My job is to get as many souls as possible to heaven, and I have noticed that you are at your most spiritually open when the place is in flames, so I'm going to torch the joint.' It's a beautiful piece of reasoning.
INFJ|When you go through your day ... you can make a decision to be kind, to greet people kindly ... and connect, or you can make a decision to be mean, and every decision you make has these ripples.
INFJ|Archetypal elements come up again and again in my songs, but it's not intentional ... it's just what I view as an accurate reflection of real life on this planet.

INFJ|I'm involved in everything I do which isn't always efficient. ... But in that sense, everything I do has a comprehensiveness to it.
INFJ|You can be standing right in front of the truth and not necessarily see it. People only get it when they're ready to get it.
INFJ|If you want to know anything in this life, you just have to knock on the door. As I was lucky to find: It's all within.

INFJ|She has a regal, almost patrician bearing.
INFJ|Her good manners can be mistaken for cold seriousness.

ISFJ|He has a small-town, plain-spoken personality.
ISFJ|Even his opponents ... describe him as extremely disciplined and cordial ... polite, professional and gentlemanly.

ESFJ|Even though I'm famous I don't need to watch myself on TV, like some others.

ISTJ|There is nothing quite like the family gathering in familiar surroundings and in the traditional atmosphere of love and happiness that springs from the enjoyment of simple well-tried things.

ISTJ|Take ... responsibility for yourself. ... Self responsibility is a big, big thing as far as being able to maintain ethical behavior goes.
ISTJ|I had no ambition to be on stage. As a person, I pretty much am who I seem to be on television; I'm a little bit deadpan.
ISTJ|I don't want an average person making important decisions. ... People who are in charge of making decisions should have some credentials for being given the responsibility. If you want to drive a car, you need a driver's license.
ISTJ|Jamie has a calm, no-nonsense attitude, and a tendency to grumble at anything he considers silly or unnecessary.
ISTJ|There's a lot of common sense ... which I feel like we have lost touch with.
ISTJ|Stand up for your principles and be loyal to your friends and family.
ISTJ|I always had a lot of confidence in my work ... but other than that I'm not a huge dreamer.
ISTJ|When all the shit goes down and the world's about to end, Offerman would be a guy I'd want by my side.

ISTJ|I always liked school.
ISTJ|As a child I was good at working with adults.
ISTJ|I had a fashion designer tell me that when I wear a dress of his, it sells out across the country. ... It made me sad, because I want to be an influence in ways other than by wearing a pretty dress.
ISTJ|I don't mean to criticize anyone. ... I think people should have fun, and have a good time, and enjoy the luck that we have to be lazy and dwell in consumerism. But ... it's a balance. ... I just think it's an important thing to engage in the world.
ISTJ|I believe in finishing what I started.
ISTJ|While I like to explore new territory, deep down there's a piece of me that stays pretty consistent.
ISTJ|I really am a homebody. I like having a wife and a kid and coming home every day for dinner and doing household tasks.
ISTJ|I did not set out to do a fun band. I am really serious about my music and somehow that works.
ISTJ|He maintains an elaborate ... spreadsheet that catalogs all the songs he's written. Presenting it he seems more excited about the spreadsheet than the prolificacy it documents.
ISTJ|He comes across more like an engineer than the lead singer of a band.
ISTJ|I'd had people say, 'You'll enjoy being famous for a week, and you'll never enjoy it again.' But I don't think I had that week. I may have been working and missed that moment.

ISTJ|I appreciate people who take their work very seriously and who exhibit discipline and commitment.

ISTJ|Almost every single section in my books has a real-life application. ... I'm putting girls in situations that they might actually experience in their lives.
ESTJ|What I personally want to know about a leader is this: ... Will he take decisions, accepting full responsibility?
ESTJ|The good military leader will dominate the events which surround him; once he lets events get the better of him ... he will cease to be of value as a leader.
ESTJ|Throughout my life I have followed my duty and my conscience. I have never been afraid to say what I believed to be right.
ESTJ|A commander must have ... that determination which enables him to stand firm.
ESTJ|He had an extraordinary capacity for putting his finger straight on the essentials of any problem, and of being able to explain them simply and clearly.
ESTJ|In my mind nothing is more abhorrent than a life of ease. ... There is no place in civilization for the idler.
ESTJ|Results ... always come if you work hard enough.
ESTJ|I have no quarrel with the general attitude of scoffing at new ideas. It is better ... than to rush around in a continuous brainstorm after every new idea.
ESTJ|An idea is just an idea. Almost anyone can think up an idea. The thing that counts is developing it into a practical product.
ESTJ|Any customer can have a car painted any color that he wants. So long as it is black.
ESTJ|You persevere until you see it through. ... I never did any U-turns.
ESTJ|There's no point in living an 'if only' life. You've got to say: 'This happened!'

ESTJ|Hard work, grit and determination were the order of her day.
ESTJ|She was as tough as they come, and anything that required guts and will she could do.
ESTJ|I've always believed that people should be judged on the basis of actions ... and not just what they ... claim to stand for.
ESTJ|We should solve problems one by one by hard work ... and persistence, and that will ... aggregate to the grand solutions.
ESTJ|If you believe in something, you had better be prepared to defend it.
ESTJ|Unthinking emotion is pitiful to me.
ESTJ|Frankly, I see a lot of little girls dressed in ways I think are not very appropriate. It's too much too soon. ... Parents have to draw the line.
ESTJ|I'm someone who gets on with the job ... says it as I see it and actually delivers on what I say.
ESTJ|Showing that you can do something, that you're in the job and doing it, is more important than the back story.
ESTJ|What makes you depressed?
ESTJ|She has an image of ... dependability and unflappability. ... It is her toughness which has become her political hallmark.
ESTJ|She comes across as straightforward, shrewd and reassuringly staid. Unlike Tony Blair or David Cameron, she does not schmooze.
ESTJ|People may oppose you, but when they realize you can hurt them, they'll join your side.
ESTJ|When are we going to stop making excuses for the terrorists and saying that somebody is making them do it? No, these are simply evil people who want to kill.
ESTJ|I am somebody who is very data-driven.
ESTJ|I've always found the hedonistic or anarchist view of freedom troubling.
ESTJ|Condi Rice was, even back then, not a person to be trifled with.
ESTJ|Condi is the kind of person who is very sure of herself and makes excellent decisions.
ESTJ|Without hard work, your passion is all for naught. You never have time to rest on your laurels.
ESTJ|I can be fair and decisive and encouraging as well as demanding.
ESTJ|I am a hero worshiper. I love the number one tennis player. I love the number one baseball player.
ESTJ|I have sometimes ... forgotten ... to pat the back of someone or say 'thank you.' ... I wish I were just the nicest person but I am a business person.
ESTJ|Role modeling what good families should look like is important. And my view is that if you can't run your own house, you certainly can't run the White House.
ESTJ|What we need right now is leadership; we need people with judgment; we need decent people, people with common sense, people with strong family values.
ESTJ|I like to do something. ... I just don't get into symbolic achievements.
ESTJ|This is what it means to be a citizen in a republic. ... You can vote for a ... clown, but then you have to take some responsibility to correct your mistake.
ESTJ|The answer to any question beginning 'Is it important to you as a woman' is: No ... I would hold the same positions if I were a man.
ESTJ|In only one respect does practicing law compare favorably with practicing punditry. ... In the law, there are standards, rules, and precedents that must be adhered to by everyone.
ESTJ|When it comes to speaking and writing on unpleasant matters, I learned a long time ago to stop apologizing. It is a waste of breath, time, and energy.
ESTJ|My book 'Invasion' was inspired by patriotic, level-headed, and hard-truth-telling Americans.
ESTJ|'Asian Ann Coulter'
ESTJ|Janitors in newsrooms across America worked overtime in the halcyon days after Barack Obama won the presidency. It wasn't easy cleaning the drool off laptops and floors.
ESTJ|Just because it makes you feel uncomfortable, that doesn't mean it has to change.
ESTJ|I heard ... Dr. Phil say the only difference between you and someone you envy is that you settled for less.
ESTJ|She is is known for direct, no-nonsense reporting.
ESTJ|She can be just as tough as nails and bear down on people.
ESTJ|My programs are trying to fight the good fight. The culture war is serious and needs to be fought honestly and effectively. We do that on my show. And we do it with no fear.
ESTJ|My weapons are the facts.
ESTJ|I believe the United States was well founded and has done enormous good for the world.
ESTJ|Remember this: Whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows generously will also reap generously.
ESTJ|We Christians do not lose heart. Rather, we have renounced secret and shameful ways; we do not use deception, nor do we distort. ... On the contrary, by setting forth the truth plainly we commend ourselves to everyone's conscience.
ESTJ|Do not be misled: 'Bad company corrupts good character.'
ESTJ|Now this is my boast: I have conducted myself in the world ... with integrity and sincerity.
ESTJ|We demolish every argument and every pretension that sets itself up against our goal, and we take captive every thought to make it obedient. ... And we will be ready to punish every act of disobedience.
ESTJ|Heaven is not a place of idleness.
ESTJ|I feel sorry for the man who has never taken a stand and stuck to it fearlessly. Moral courage has rewards that the timid can never imagine.
ESTJ|Even as a child lying, cheating, stealing, and property destruction were foreign to me.
ESTJ|Growing up I could abandon myself enthusiastically to milking the cows and cleaning out the latrines, not because they were pleasant jobs, certainly, but because sweaty labor held its own satisfaction.
ESTJ|I do not believe that anyone has ever been successful in life without ... diligence and hard work.
ESTJ|Young people have been taught that there are no absolutes in our world today. Our society is greatly void of discipline and character-building.
ESTJ|Socialism and welfarism teaches young people to believe that the world owes them a living whether they work or not.
ESTJ|Our forefathers ... knew the great responsibility that freedom carries with it.
ESTJ|Every American who looks at the facts must share a deep concern and burden for our country.

ESTJ|I've always broken a challenge down into smaller challenges, which I could get on with in my methodical fashion.
ESTJ|Terrorism ... is an annoyance like a mosquito. ... A mosquito is an annoyance, but you can swat it.
ESTJ|All 9/11 succeeded in doing was getting us very, very angry. And getting America angry is not a good career move.
ESTJ|I like spending time with Marine Corps sergeants because they're like the chiefs. ... You don't impress a chief by being a fake.
ESTJ|We Americans extend liberty to others ... we've done it to Europe, we've done it in Asia, we did it in Kuwait. Bringing our gift of liberty to others is a great American tradition.
ESTJ|We live in an age when everybody tries to blame someone or something for their failures.
ESTJ|It is virtually impossible to flip the TV channels without seeing a bevy of sobbing women and men justifying their failed lives by reference to some past abuse. ... Personal responsibility does not sell soap as well as sob stories.
ESTJ|I want to SHAME my opponents. ... We don't do enough shaming in this country.
ESTJ|I am a hero worshiper.
ESTJ|If a soldier does not see the logic he will not perform as well or be as obedient. A soldier must be convinced, otherwise discipline is a problem.
ESTJ|No one in America asked Bush what sort of rational analysis or realistic information led to the claim that Iraq had WMD.
ESTJ|I am neither a hypocrite nor a weakling.
ESTJ|Saddam's speech patterns score low on expressions of feeling and feature almost no metaphors.
ESTJ|It's not as if anyone is worried that through some horrible miscalculation we could be removing the Iraqi Abraham Lincoln by mistake.
ESTJ|I am going to die. The person who succeeds me will also die. But elections, you won't have.
ESTJ|I'm not someone who ... sends out threats. I warn only once. The day they touch one of my men, the rule of law is over.
ESTJ|Not a single leaf moves in this country if I'm not the one moving it. I want that to be clear.
ESTJ|Pinochet is the toughest nut I've ever seen. He makes other dictators look like a bunch of patsies.
ESTJ|England is his favorite country ... because of its civility and moderation, its respect for rules. As an example, he pointed to the impeccable driving habits of the British.
ESTJ|I think ass-kicking is sort of thrilling. ... As a female ... you're taught not to be aggressive.
ESTJ|It gives you a great self-confidence ... to take full responsibility for your life. Responsibility gives confidence, I find.
ESTJ|I had to work hard to do the comical elements of my roles.
ESTJ|I'm a mother and and any parent knows this dynamic: ... You're on the playground and some kid comes over and kicks sand in your kid's face and you're like: 'What do I do now - I want to kill?!'
ESTJ|'Kill Bill'
ESTJ|I like people who are very direct. They don't beat around the bush. ... It's not that they're impolite. They're just very direct, and they don't have time to mess around. ... I enjoy that kind of directness.
ESTJ|I don't think if I disagree with someone I'll start beating on them! At least not the first or second time. Maybe the third time they're not listening, then the punches come out.
ESTJ|It's not my job to go around shucking and jiving until everyone realizes what a nice person I am.
ESTJ|Her best-known role, Ling Woo in the hit TV series 'Ally McBeal', a role the writer created specifically for her, was ... aggressive and unemotional.
ESTJ|I feel like young girls are told they have to be this kind of princess and be all this sweet stuff. It's all bullshit. I identify more with being a warrior princess and kicking ass.
ESTJ|Like Hermione I'm terrified of getting into trouble. I'm very heady in the same way that she is. ... She's very determined. I am as well.
ESTJ|I actually wouldn't ever need a good behavior clause in my contract. It's just not necessary. I'm not tempted by parties or drugs.
ESTJ|There's something efficient about her, as though life is a big to-do list that needs to be addressed.
ESTJ|I'm not a passive person by any stretch of the imagination.
ESTJ|You never have to guess where you stand with me.
ESTJ|I'm very hands-on.
ESTJ|For someone so petite, the energy comes XXXL. ... She is upbeat and plain-speaking.
ESTJ|It was always extraordinary to me that emotion never clouded her professionalism.
ESTJ|Originally, Courteney auditioned for 'Friends' and won the part of Rachel. But she felt the character of Monica with her ... need for order was more her.
ESTJ|I'm a law-and-order person.
ESTJ|I've always had a tremendous sense of responsibility - work, work, work.
ESTJ|As a child I was the one who raked the leaves and cut the grass and shovelled the snow and cleaned the dishes. My brothers were like hillbillies. They had no sense of responsibility.
ESTJ|I'm not afraid of anybody. Wherever I go, I don't have a drop of fear in my whole body.
ESTJ|I would like to be Governor of New York. That would be exciting to me.
ESTJ|His acting has some beguiling note of severity, even cruelty.
ESTJ|I'm tenacious to the point where most people just aren't. Honestly, I'm that tenacious.
ESTJ|You show up for work! That's what you do. Long run - you work! It's a blessing. ... You show up every damn day.
ESTJ|I prefer adversity that I face head-on.
ESTJ|Me directing was simply a matter of time for me. ... I felt very comfortable in that seat. ... I like organizing where the shots are.
ESTJ|I'm brutal when I direct. ... I constantly harass the actor; I beat him down.
ESTJ|My judgment doesn't involve taste. It involves a deep-seated conviction that something is right, has always been right, and always will be.
ESTJ|I have a reputation as the fastest writer in town. I'm not faster. I spend less time not writing.
ESTJ|Most Americans don't understand ... that it's the responsibility of the citizen to speak out.
ESTJ|His wrath, when deployed, is legendary. 'I Hated, Hated, HATED This Movie!' and 'Your Movie Sucks' are two compilations of his critical reviews.
ESTJ|Awareness without action is worthless. Sometimes you make the right decision, sometimes you make the decision right.
ESTJ|Life rewards action.
ESTJ|Life is managed; it is not cured.
ESTJ|If parents aren't united in terms of discipline ... focus, morals, values ... then the child is going to be a product of inconsistency, and that creates confusion.
ESTJ|Dr. Phil issues counsel as marching orders.
ESTJ|He overcame adversity through setting goals and he was persistent in achieving success.
ESTJ|The truth is not always nice or polite or easy. ... Sometimes it's harsh, and it hurts.
ESTJ|As a prosecutor I was staring down criminals and badgering judges into meting out tough sentences.
ESTJ|When I get into an argument on the air, the man can always yell louder because if a man fights like hell, he's being forceful; if I raise my voice and fight like hell, I'm being a shrew and a bitch.
ESTJ|I consider myself an advocate for innocent children - their voice in a world that, though essentially good, is embattled by evil.
ESTJ|I always felt like one of the guys.
ESTJ|I don't say what's on my mind to be charming.
ESTJ|Do you find yourself coming up with excuses as to why it's not your fault when shit hits the fan? ... How often should you be taking some sort of accountability in situations that occur? I would say, every time.
ESTJ|There are some moms like me that I call black belt moms that will chop through the system. When they are told that they can't get an appointment, they're going to get one the next day.
ESTJ|I am getting people to stop doing wrong and start doing right.
ESTJ|In an age of moral relativity, Dr. Laura's certitude compels. ... Schlessinger's fervor is indisputably evangelical, and her listeners believe her to be a paragon, a beacon of hope and rectitude in a dissolute, degraded world.
ESTJ|The main message of my show is that people have to be responsible for their own actions.
ESTJ|You have to find something else to do with your time, constructively, rather than make children who are going to grow up with no moral compass like their mother.
ESTJ|I'm quite a together person, and I value the right things.
ESTJ|No. If I loved partying it would be more of a concern. ... You see other actors say, 'I didn't ask for this,' but I completely see what my role in 'Star Wars' might mean to young girls, and ... I take responsibility for that.
ESTJ|She has an idea of how she'd use the Force in real life: She'd move people standing on the wrong side of the escalator. ... 'You have to walk on the left and stand on the right,' she said. 'People who stand on the left are so annoying ... so I'd use the Force to shift them over to the right.'
ESTJ|I was always a feminine tomboy. I always dressed like a girl and acted like a boy.
ESTJ|I have a tough skin and enough confidence not to worry too much about being underestimated.
ESTJ|I was a serious young teenager.
ESTJ|I always go to bed with an empty inbox. ... I feel that going into a day and having your plate cleared is a good way to start out.
ENTJ|An empty throne always tempts me.
ENTJ|Ambition is never in a greater hurry than I. It merely keeps pace with my way of thinking.
ENTJ|Men are moved by two levers only: Fear and self-interest.
ENTJ|Glory is fleeting, but obscurity is forever.
ENTJ|Napoleon swept away everywhere the establishments of feudality. ... He was Caesar himself.
ENTJ|His presence on the field makes the difference of forty thousand men.
ENTJ|Napoleon deployed every available resource to inflict all-out defeats on his enemies.
ENTJ|I would rather be first in a village than second in Rome.
ENTJ|Veni, vidi, vici.
ENTJ|If you must break the law, do it to seize power: In all other cases observe it.
ENTJ|No one is so brave that he is not disturbed by some unexpected twist in his plan.
ENTJ|If I fail it is only because I have too much pride and ambition.
ENTJ|He conquers twice, who shows mercy to the conquered.
ENTJ|Microsoft has had clear competitors in the past. It's a good thing we have museums to document that.
ENTJ|It was tough not to back off against Bill, with his intellect and foot tapping and body rocking; he came on like a force of nature. The irony was that Bill liked it when someone pushed back and drilled down with him to get to the best solution.
ENTJ|Gates is a fierce competitor. In everything he does, he is driven to win.
ENTJ|Gates believes everything can be ... reduced to essentials and rearranged into a logical sequence that will achieve a particular goal.
ENTJ|How many a dispute could have been deflated into a single paragraph if the disputants had dared to define their terms!
ENTJ|With regard to excellence, it is not enough to know, but we must try to have and use it.
ENTJ|Make your hurry bristle with deliberateness and use pardon as an instrument of power. Then I guarantee you many subjects.

ENTJ|Jung is to Freud as Plato is to Aristotle.
ENTJ|A nation that prefers disgrace to danger is prepared for a master and deserves one.
ENTJ|Power over a man's salary is power over his will.
ENTJ|Men love power.
ENTJ|The three greatest men in history are Bacon, Newton and Locke.
ENTJ|He is really a colossus ... Even without the support of others, he is a host in himself.
ENTJ|Hamilton possessed all the confidence of a military leader accustomed to command.
ENTJ|My nature is that I have to excite myself with a big challenge.
ENTJ|My ... style requires tremendous energy and labor.
ENTJ|I used to attack because it was the only thing I knew. Now I attack because I know it works best.
ENTJ|I know that there is aways a time and place for diplomacy, but I also know that you win more often when you negotiate from a position of strength.
ENTJ|The victories of Hannibal and Napoleon.
ENTJ|You should think of me as a political party leader. I was a politician before I was a 'democracy icon.'
ENTJ|As the leader of a party you have to aspire to the leadership of the nation, because that means your party will have won, and every party wants to win.
ENTJ|I like intelligent people.
ENTJ|Truth is a powerful weapon.
ENTJ|Melodrama is very silly.
ENTJ|Can you imagine yourself as the leader of Burma having to use violence against humans, to use force to kill people?
ENTJ|She does not suffer fools gladly, and one of her colleagues describes her as a workaholic.
ENTJ|Valid criticism is doing you a favor.
ENTJ|We should not be willing to tolerate ignorance and complacency.
ENTJ|We live in a society absolutely dependent on science and technology and yet have cleverly arranged things so that almost no one understands science and technology. That's a clear prescription for disaster.
ENTJ|It is far better to grasp the universe as it really is than to persist in delusion, however satisfying and reassuring.
ENTJ|He was very intolerant of anything irrational.
ENTJ|He never listened to anything on any kind of emotional level. ... He was ... untouched and untouchable.
ENTJ|A campaign that is run by me has a strategic plan, discipline, and a bias for action. It is structured to keep momentum.
ENTJ|I set goals and repeatedly check performance against those goals.
ENTJ|I acknowledge and directly confront critics.
ENTJ|I want a bridge from the world of ideas to the world of practical politics.
ENTJ|I have always wanted to have better research and more of it than any of my competitors.
ENTJ|Staying on offense is important and ... once you are on the defense, it is hard to regain control.
ENTJ|Principle is okay up to a certain point, but principle doesn't do any good if you lose.
ENTJ|I didn't become Vice President out of a desire to be popular. You've got to be willing in this business to take the slings and arrows when they come your way. What's important is to do ... what needs to be done.
ENTJ|It has been said that with Dick Cheney's failing heart, George W. Bush is just a heartbeat away from the presidency.
ENTJ|Obama and I share ... a sense of impatience to get things done.
ENTJ|The place where you can most impact people's lives and leave your thumbprint ... is from the White House.
ENTJ|... of course it's his presidency, et cetera...
ENTJ|There is in all human beings a natural instinct for power.
ENTJ|Modern politics seems to require and reward some capacities that I don't think I have ... such as a tolerance for ... spin rather than an honest discussion of substance. ... Apparently, it comes easily for some people, but not for me.
ENTJ|Too many of the world's leaders are ... decided only to be undecided.
ENTJ|While the young Gore was a bit reserved, he was not an introvert ... and ... had an enthusiasm for ... competitions of all sorts.
ENTJ|Al Gore's book 'Our Choice' is a great book.
ENTJ|I'm goal-driven and very determined.
ENTJ|The positive side of stubbornness is dogged determination.
ENTJ|I'm a practicing one. I'm not a 'talk-about-it' one.
ENTJ|When people try to bond and buddy up to Jeb he begins to chat, too. About education reform. Or Medicaid statistics. Or the judicial nominating process.
ENTJ|To a large extent, Bush's appetite for direct control has been one of his strongest assets.
ENTJ|As governor his domineering personality ... reordered the entire governance structure of the state.
ENTJ|If people want to enjoy ... benefits ... they have to accept their responsibilities.
ENTJ|When I am met with stupid criticism ... I respond immediately and forcefully. ... I will not allow myself to be on the defensive.
ENTJ|I am in general very hard on people.
ENTJ|He is not like those leftists who are more invested in the symbolism than in the outcome.
ENTJ|He likes to hit lots of meetings, quick, businesslike transactions.
ENTJ|Small talk and false ingratiations are not his thing.
ENTJ|There is an undeniable force in Sanders' personality.
ENTJ|I am a person with strong opinions and a tendency to express them.
ENTJ|I have the capability of telling it like it is.
ENTJ|There is no doubt that if you aim high enough, you will ... meet resistance. ... But no matter how tough the opposition may seem: Have courage - and persevere.
ENTJ|I do not share the popular distaste for politicians. People in politics ... put their egos on the line, work hard, take risks, and the best of them accomplish things of real and lasting value.
ENTJ|I'm not saying that the whole world would be a lot better if it were run by women. If you think that, you've forgotten high school.
ENTJ|Anybody who's ever dealt with me knows not to mess with me.
ENTJ|Politics is not for the faint of heart.
ENTJ|Bipartisanship is nice, but it cannot be a substitute for action, not having it cannot prevent us from going forward.
ENTJ|My biggest fight has been between those who wanted to do something incremental and those like me who wanted to do something comprehensive.
ENTJ|I say to my colleagues: 'Never confine your best work ... to what will be signed by George W. Bush because that is too limiting a factor.'
ENTJ|'30 Rock'
ENTJ|The only reason people are willing to pay me $400 million is because the people who invest in me get results beyond their expectations.
ENTJ|I don't stop and think about what I've accomplished because there's always tomorrow.
ENTJ|Compassion is no substitute for justice.
ENTJ|No. ... Why would I want socialism to succeed?
ENTJ|I admire Sarah Palin's backbone. ... There are not many politicians who've been through what she's been put through and are still able to smile. ... This woman is pretty tough.
ENTJ|I am brutally honest and outspoken. I am impatient and, to many, abrasive.
ENTJ|The world isn't that complex!
ENTJ|Can you say yes or no? Or are you one of those people that always wants a little more data? A 'maybe' person. ... I hate those people!
ENTJ|Self-confident people aren't afraid to have their views challenged. They relish the intellectual combat.
ENTJ|I greatly admire Jack Welch's utterly ruthlessly focused management. At GE they make decisions; they are incredibly disciplined and focused.
ENTJ|My principles triumph; they do not 'compromise.'
ENTJ|Ivan the Terrible would execute someone and then spend a long time repenting and praying. He let God get in his way in this matter. He ought to have been more decisive!
ENTJ|I have made it so that in the Soviet army, it takes more courage to retreat than to advance.
ENTJ|He spoke with cruelty and radiated energy, his words imbued with a raw power and singlemindedness.

ENTJ|It's hard to orchestrate anarchy every night.
ENTJ|There are responsibilities greater than individual feelings in life.
ENTJ|Emotionally I'm very immature.
ENTJ|He has one of the best work ethics of anybody I've ever been in business with. ... That's the way he's built.

ENTJ|No one wants to hear you complain.
ENTJ|You work ten times harder than I do.
ENTJ|I like to work fast. I like to keep moving forward.
ENTJ|If you get the vision settled upfront, the following through will only be about execution, and a much more enjoyable process.
ENTJ|I'm a current-events guy, I'm a non-fiction reader, and I like to deal ... with whatever issues ... affect modern man.
ENTJ|He had a hatred and contempt for the world of entertainment when he was growing up; I thought he might make a good lawyer.
ENTJ|One of the great gifts of working with Michael Douglas is that ... he sees the overview ... a lot clearer than you do. He doesn't get bogged down in minutiae.
ENTJ|Juggling is very much in line with my heart. ... Juggling is very, very straightforward; very, very black and white; you're manipulating objects, not people. And that's always appealed to me.
ENTJ|Everybody should be busted on their bullshit all the time because I think that's the way we get to truth. That is also what respect is. ... What we call 'tolerance' is often just condescending.
ENTJ|I never wanted to be a comedian. I never wanted to be on stage.
ENTJ|I love the feeling of being in charge.
ENTJ|I am definitely attracted to characters that are tough, and you have to break through that exterior.
ENTJ|To be a model wasn't ... satisfying for me because I like to say what's on my mind.
ENTJ|I don't think I'm a natural performer.
ENTJ|That's all bullshit. ... If there's a demand from the audience, the screenwriters will deliver it.
ENTJ|She has this Kate Hepburn quality: One of the guys.
ENTJ|Charlize is a force of nature ... with crushing sex appeal.
ENTJ|Success comes from finding out where you went wrong and correcting it.
ENTJ|Each of us has to learn responsibility. ... Here we are. Live up to your potential.
ENTJ|I have brains ... and a handy head of common sense.
ENTJ|I can only compare her to a young bull about to charge.
ENTJ|Her aggressiveness is that of the sun at high noon.
ENTJ|I was always the same. I had a very definite personality and I liked material that showed that personality. ... So, was I an actor? I don't know.
ENTJ|She was tough and very formidable. She was opinionated about everything.
ENTJ|Acting doesn't feel good. It's not comfortable to feel all this stuff, it's not!
ENTJ|I don't find glamour and clothing relevant.
ENTJ|Casting directors have told me I am too edgy, too tough, too tomboy, too strong.
ENTJ|Woody Allen and I have great chemistry.
ENTJ|She has a quietly forceful way of speaking, words marching out of her mouth in husky cadences that bring Katharine Hepburn to mind.
ENTJ|I'm a big personality. I walk into a room, big and tall and loud.
ENTJ|I was a thick-skinned girl from a very young age.
ENTJ|'The Godfather' is my favorite film.
ENTJ|I have absolutely no intention of going into acting or making perfumes. ... I will stick to what I am good at and not spread myself thin and become mediocre at everything I do.
ENTJ|In my relationships I'm never very good at saying how I feel and talking about it, even if they are and they try and bring it out with me.
ENTJ|When I order a glass of white wine and the waitress asks what kind and I hesitate for a moment, Adele jumps in with a funny/charming/controlling burst of impatience and orders for me.
ENTJ|I've always been one of the guys.
ENTJ|I didn't enjoy making a living off of how I look, so I bowed out.
INTJ|I can calculate the motion of heavenly bodies, but not the madness of people.
INTJ|I have studied these things - you have not.
INTJ|Mechanics has been distinguished from geometry, as what is perfectly accurate from what is less so. But the errors are not in the art, but in the artificers.
INTJ|Newton was not the first of the age of reason. He was the last of the magicians.
INTJ|Philosophers have hitherto only interpreted the world in various ways; the point is to change it.
INTJ|I do not care one straw for popularity.
INTJ|My chief characteristic is singleness of purpose and my idea of happiness is to fight.
INTJ|It is a bad thing to perform menial duties ... to fight with pinpricks, instead of clubs.
INTJ|Karl Marx was the most consistent translator of the altruist morality into practical action.
INTJ|All the sophisticated syllogisms ... cannot conceal that Marx was a prophet communicating a revelation.
INTJ|While animals survive by adjusting themselves to their background, man survives by adjusting his background to himself.
INTJ|Love is not self-sacrifice, but the assertion of your own needs and values. It is for your own happiness that you need the person you love.
INTJ|I will never live for the sake of another man, nor ask another man to live for mine.
INTJ|In philosophy, I can only recommend the three A's: Aristotle, Aquinas, and Ayn Rand.
INTJ|Few writers convey an irresistible ferocity of convictions as Rand does.
INTJ|What is good? All that heightens the feeling of power, power itself in man. What is bad? All that proceeds from weakness.
INTJ|Active, successful natures shun the dictum 'know thyself' and follow the commandment: 'Will thyself.'
INTJ|Not all men ought to be free. There are many who threw off their final worth when they threw off their bondage.
INTJ|I'm going to change the world.
INTJ|I think that the next five years are going to be characterized by widespread acknowledgement by others ... that my way is the way that stuff should be and will be better.
INTJ|Having two identities for yourself is a lack of integrity.
INTJ|He is shy and introverted and he often does not seem very warm to people who don't know him.
INTJ|He had imperial tendencies.
INTJ|Yahoo tried to buy Facebook for $1 billion. ... Many people thought Mark was crazy for not selling. But he always had a plan and a vision.
INTJ|My career has been focused on finding practical, effective solutions to real-world problems.
INTJ|I started SpaceX because if we're not on a path of ... expanding to the stars, then what we're effectively saying is that we're going to consign ourselves to Earth until an extinction event wipes us out.
INTJ|Elon's psyche is tied up in the idea of changing the world.
INTJ|I am astonished at your entrepreneurial spirit, your tenacity, and your ability to get things done.
INTJ|I don't think I've ever seen an entrepreneur with so much resolve.
INTJ|Most people are sheep, and they need the support of others.
INTJ|You have to mix with all those stupid kids. And the teachers are even stupider than the kids.
INTJ|Nobody has single-handedly done more for the U.S. image than me. ... Before I came along the U.S. had an image of a football country, baseball country, but nobody thought of it as an intellectual country. I turned all that around single-handedly.
INTJ|He is absolutely not social. He is not adaptable to everybody's standards of life. He ... is unwilling to compromise.
INTJ|Fischer had no one besides himself to draw him up to the heights he reached. ... I regard him as a mythological creature of sorts.
INTJ|My ideas have revolutionized the industries of the United States.
INTJ|The ... development of man has as its ultimate purpose the complete mastery of mind over the material world.
INTJ|The world was not prepared for my work. It was too far ahead of time, but ... in the end it will be a triumphal success.
INTJ|If Edison had a needle to find in a haystack, he would proceed at once with ... diligence ... to examine straw after straw. ... I was a sorry witness of such doings, knowing that a little theory and calculation would have saved him 90% of his labor.
INTJ|Everyone misunderstood Tesla. ... He did dream but he made his dreams come true. He had visions but they were of a real future, not an imaginary one. ... We must admit he was a prophet.
INTJ|My goal is simple. It is a complete understanding of the universe.
INTJ|I regard my version of quantum physics as self-evidently correct.
INTJ|I don't believe that the ultimate theory will come by steady work along existing lines.
INTJ|For millions of years, mankind lived just like the animals. Then we unleashed the power of our imagination.
INTJ|Philosophy is dead. Scientists have become the bearers of the torch of discovery in our quest for knowledge.
INTJ|Kant's works are very obscure.
INTJ|He is the most stubborn man I know. ... It was clear very early on that he was a genius, but his popular appeal came as a surprise.
INTJ null
INTJ|Don't ... depend on current fashion or ... popular opinion.
INTJ|When I am thinking rationally ... in the style that is characteristic of scientists ... this is not entirely a matter of joy.
INTJ|One could think of Zarathustra as simply a madman. ... But without his 'madness' he would have been only another of the ... billions of human individuals who have lived and then been forgotten.
INTJ|Even as a student, his indifference to others' skepticism, doubt, and ridicule was awesome.
INTJ|His heroes were solitary thinkers and supermen like Newton and Nietzsche.
INTJ|Nash acquired his knowledge not from studying ... but by seeing the truth for himself. ... Einstein once chided him for wishing to amend relativity theory without studying physics.
INTJ|The country does not need an iron-cast economic doctrine as long as it has me.
INTJ|Words ought to be a little wild, for they are the assault of thoughts on the unthinking.
INTJ|Hayek's work is an extraordinary example of how, starting with a mistake, a remorseless logician can end up in bedlam.
INTJ|Keynes spoke on a great range of topics, on some of which he was thoroughly an expert, but on others he had derived his views from the few pages of a book at which he had happened to glance. The air of authority was the same in both cases.
INTJ|Keynes was such a brilliant and fascinating guy that he hypnotized a whole generation of economists.
INTJ|I have been right about everything.
INTJ|People who disagree with me are always wrong. And not just wrong, they're often knaves or fools.
INTJ|Coming up with a good idea, with an insight into the way the world works that is really new and that you really believe in, is a deeply satisfying experience.
INTJ|The intellectually insecure ... have created for themselves an alternative intellectual history in which John Maynard Keynes was a fraud.
INTJ|To follow my recommendations requires a level of intellectual flexibility that not many people are going to show.
INTJ|Paul Krugman has virtually become the leader of the opposition in America, an unusual position for an academic economist.
INTJ|Thanks to God that he gave me stubbornness when I know I am right.
INTJ|Nineteen twentieths of mankind is opaque and unenlightened. Intimacy with most people will make you acquainted with vices and errors and follies enough to make you despise them.
INTJ|Politeness, delicacy and decency ... are but three different names for hypocrisy, chicanery, and cowardice.
INTJ|He saw the whole of a subject at a glance, and ... was equally fearless of men and of the consequences of the bold assertion of his opinion. ... He was a stranger to dissimulation.
INTJ|Those people who think they know everything are a great annoyance to those of us who do.
INTJ|Never let your sense of morals get in the way of doing what's right.
INTJ|People think a scientist is cold ... and uses only his reason; he argues carefully step by step, and needs no imagination. That is all wrong. ... The true scientist is quite imaginative as well as rational, and sometimes leaps to solutions where reason can follow only slowly.
INTJ|I never tried to hide my superior mentality. I demonstrated it every day ... and I never ... thought of being 'modest' about the matter.
INTJ|Those who are determined to be 'offended' will discover a provocation somewhere. We cannot possibly adjust enough to please the fanatics, and it is degrading to make the attempt.
INTJ|Distrust compassion; prefer dignity for yourself and others.
INTJ|George W. Bush is unusually incurious, abnormally unintelligent, amazingly inarticulate ... and apparently quite proud of all these things.
INTJ|His obituaries were particularly refreshing, because he refused to moderate his opinion of the subject simply because he or she had died.
INTJ|If ever a man is to achieve anything like dignity, it can happen only if superior men are given absolute freedom to think what they want to think and say what they want to say.
INTJ|People constantly speak of 'the government' doing this or that, as they might speak of God doing it. But the government is really nothing but a group of men, and usually they are very inferior men.
INTJ|FDR had every quality that morons esteem in their heroes.
INTJ|He was supremely 'inner-directed' with no inner shame or quaking at going against the judgment of the herd.
INTJ|Faith without deeds is dead.
INTJ|I shall not have my teaching judged by any man. ... Since I am certain of it, I shall be the judge.
INTJ|As to my always conducting discussions with ardor ... I am simply overpowered by the force of truth when ... compelled to the discussion.
INTJ|There is something sublime about him dragging popes and kings into his intellectual wrestling ring and handling them with the roughness of a miner's son.
INTJ|He is a little too insolent in his reproaches and more caustic than is prudent for an innovator in religion.
INTJ|I want to restore the human race to its full totality.
INTJ|It is easier to discover a deficiency in individuals ... than to see their real import or value.
INTJ|My thought is by its nature something esoteric, neither made for the mob nor capable of being prepared for the mob.
INTJ|What is rational is actual and what is actual is rational.
INTJ|Heraclitus is the one who ... first grasped Being. ... The origin of philosophy is to be dated from Heraclitus.
INTJ|You are guided more by your gift of synthesis than by calm analysis.
INTJ|One man is worth ten thousand if he is extraordinary.
INTJ|Most men have sated themselves like cattle. ... Greater men are allotted greater destinies.
INTJ|Heraclitus' meanings are not crystallized but inhere in integral images and visions, grasped as an indissoluble whole.
INTJ|If Heraclitus was a physicist, he, like Newton, was at the same time also a mystic.
INTJ|Heraclitus had the highest form of pride stemming from a certainty of belief in the truth as grasped by himself alone.
INTJ|As far as men are concerned, it is not what they are that interests me but what they can become.
INTJ|You are nothing else but what you live. ... A man is no more than a series of undertakings and the sum of the organization that constitutes these undertakings.
INTJ|The ... dogged tenacity of his perceptions grasped the very essence of things.
INTJ|Sartre knew what he wanted to do. ... His self-confidence obviously stemmed from so unshakeable a determination that one day, in one way or another his work would bear fruit.
INTJ|Trust is good. Control is better.
INTJ|Thought is by its nature capable of giving, and does give, absolute truth.
INTJ|Lenin was a very ... bossy, self-centered, competent and smart child.
INTJ|Lenin was irrevocably controlled by one ... idea: the goal. He was probably the most extreme utilitarian ... history has produced.
INTJ|Those who did not share Lenin's interpretation of Marx were showered in insults and abuse and pronounced to be absolutely worthless. He would break even with his closest friends if they did not share his vision entirely.
INTJ|It's human nature to be selfish, to seek admiration. ... We strive to be as perfect as we can be.
INTJ|I sound quite self-righteous at times and I don't like admitting it when I'm wrong.
INTJ|I have a relatively inflated ego, with a constant need to feed on an intellectual level.
INTJ|I've generally been perceived as quite arrogant ... because I do not care ... for creating or preserving social relationships.
INTJ|I do not accept or acknowledge many of the established 'social rules'. I view them as irrelevant noise.
INTJ|Art forms that appeal to leftists tend to focus on ... defeat and despair ... as if there were no hope of accomplishing anything through rational calculation.
INTJ|The leftist is anti-individualistic ... He is not the sort of person who has an inner sense of confidence in his own ability to solve his own problems and satisfy his own needs.
INTJ|It is obvious that leftists are not cool-headed logicians systematically analyzing the foundations of knowledge. They are deeply involved emotionally in their attack on truth and reality.
INTJ|Anders Breivik plagiarized almost a dozen key passages from Kaczynski's manifesto, only replacing particular words such as 'leftist' with 'cultural Marxist.'
INTJ|If you imagine a thing happening in your head, you will make it happen - that is, if your willpower is strong enough.
INTJ|I have nothing but contempt for the braindead 'sex, drugs and rock and roll' attitude of the other musicians. ... They just want to become famous, to make money and to get laid - and not to change the world.
INTJ|Your best idea ... is going to be attacked the most. You have to really be courageous about your instincts and your ideas. Otherwise you'll just knuckle under.
INTJ|Each time I make a movie, I give it everything I have. ... I think everyone should do everything they do that way.
INTJ|I build on a large scale and with intense passion.
INTJ|I know if I have an idea, no one will want to go through it. But if I persist, people will go through it.
INTJ|The goal is to make films that only you can make.
INTJ|It's better to be overly ambitious and fail than to be under-ambitious and succeed in a mundane way.
INTJ|In his films, he has defined, re-created and explored ... with a grandiosity of vision.
INTJ|People call me a perfectionist, but I'm not. I'm a rightist. I do something until it's right.
INTJ|He is notorious on set for his uncompromising and dictatorial manner.
INTJ 'Titanic'
INTJ 'Aliens'
INTJ 'Terminator'
INTJ|People accuse me of being arrogant all the time. I'm not arrogant, I'm focused.
INTJ|I want to do movies that have a strong sense of purpose.
INTJ|It is clear that Crowe is someone who says and does exactly what he wants.
INTJ|He has a distinct vision for the movies that he is a part of - and the nearly unprecedented power to will them into being.
INTJ|He's used to people bowing down ... because he's very charismatic, very bright and has such a strong presence.
INTJ|I think anything we do, you need an enormous ego to do that. ... The ego has to be satisfied.
INTJ|Normal people can be happy with a regular life. I was different. I felt there was more to life than just plodding through an average existence.
INTJ|My relationship to power and authority is that I'm all for it. ... Ninety-five percent of the people in the world need to be told what to do and how to behave.
INTJ|I consider myself an expert in looking into a particular idea or goal and then going after it without anything else in mind.
INTJ|I always play strong characters. ... I'm not sure I know how to play weak. I really don't know how.
INTJ|If I fail, at least I will have failed my way.
INTJ|As a child I thought that acting is a dumb job. Somebody else writes something and then you repeat it. How dumb is that?
INTJ|Normal is not something to aspire to, it's something to get away from.
INTJ|The characters that she's played are indicative of a very feisty intelligence.
INTJ|She is strong, honest and has a complexity that I would never presume to decipher.
INTJ|I tend to gravitate toward the more powerful roles. As opposed to the doe-eyed girl who bats her eyelashes ... because that makes me want to vomit.
INTJ|People confuse bluntness with bitchiness.
INTJ|I am very heady and intellectual and that's kind of contrary to what makes a good actor.
INTJ|I have these abstract ideas and then lose track of myself. I ... go on and on.
INTJ|One thing is clear when you're talking to Stiles: She knows her mind. ... You get the feeling that ... she doesn't suffer fools gladly.
INTJ|I am a person who is inclined to overthink.
INTJ|Normal people just aren't very interesting.
INTJ|As an actor it's frustrating playing someone stupider than you.
INTJ|Dancing and singing take me very far out of my comfort zone.
INTJ|He is gravely passionate over serious issues.
INTJ|He emits a slow-burning magnetism that reveals itself in stages.
INTJ|In school I was a disruptive smartass.
INTJ|He can be brutally honest.
INTJ|In the Sarcasm Hall of Fame, there's Bateman and then there's everyone else.
INTJ|He has a sly, dry wit ... halfway between ridiculously charming and spectacularly douchy.
INTJ|I'm trying to create a world that I wish existed as a form of subverting the world as it does exist.
INTJ|When you're forced to deal with something big ... you try to find ways to interpret the universe ... that can make you feel safer or alleviate that crazy.
INTJ|I ... tend to be ... cerebral and ... in my head most of the time.
INTJ|I find a lot of liberation in structure. ... If I know where I'm supposed to be, then I can deviate, and live in the moment.
INTJ|I have a sardonic nature.
INTJ|In conversation she is wry, erudite and free-associative.
INTJ|I've always been both a business and creative person. That's the way my brain works.
INTJ|I am a perfectionist. ... If I step away, it stops working. I know it sounds controlling, but that's how it has to be.
INTJ|It's important to stay true to yourself in order to be a successful leader in anything. Don't conform to what others are doing.
INTJ|Ashley's voice ... slices through the chatter like steel. At 21, she is ... remarkably clear and focused ... not at all the type to be talked into things.
INTJ|She comes across as very much the master of her own fate.
INTJ|I know I can be an oppressive personality because I bubble with ... schemes, and in a way it is easier for others simply to go along with me.
INTJ|I'm perfectly happy being a leader.
INTJ|I'm not ... comfortable improvising. ... I don't really have that skill. ... I'm more into writing, thinking and producing.
INTJ|Roger Waters drove the project and the other band members ceded their vision to his increasingly personal direction.
INTJ|I adopt a technique and style to make sure that I reach as many people as possible without losing my basic integrity.
INTJ|For me hustling is the ultimate metaphor for ... the struggle to win and to make sense of it all.
INTJ|It's hard to beat the entertainment value of people ... dying to be insulted, running around looking for a bullet to get in front of.
INTJ|'Malley: People who'
INTJ|I am compelled by obsession. Passion. Commitment to one thing.
INTJ|It does seem that I am drawn to playing these very driven, obsessed and single-minded individuals.
INTJ|I haven't actually played very many nice characters. ... It's not a quality that attracts me.
INTJ|It's especially satisfying ... to play the 'Number One' in anything - kings, princes, prime ministers, dictators. There really is no substitute for sitting in the biggest chair.
INTJ|He is a man of intense statements and giant gestures.
INTJ|I like to think I'm right and everybody else is wrong.
INTJ|We're a planet of ... six billion ninnies living in a civilization ... designed by a few thousand ... smart deviants.
INTJ|It's useless to expect rational behavior from the people you work with, or anybody else for that matter. If you can come to peace with the fact that you're surrounded by idiots, you'll realize that resistance is futile ... and you can sit back and have a good laugh at the expense of others.
INTJ|I prefer working on projects that have a real chance of changing the world. ... I try to have one or more 'change-the-world' projects going at all times.
INTJ|Donald Trump strikes me as the confident Dale Carnegie type.
INTJ|He is a cerebral, idiosyncratic pundit.
INTP|As I would not be a slave, so I would not be a master. This expresses my idea of democracy.
INTP|I shall try to correct errors when shown to be errors; and I shall adopt new views so fast as they shall appear to be true views.
INTP|If I had another face, do you think I would wear this one?
INTP|Jefferson's truth was an abstract truth, applicable to all men and all times. ... All honor to Jefferson.
INTP|He cared little for simple facts. ... He cared about the underlying principle of truth and justice.
INTP|To punish me for my contempt for authority, Fate made me an authority myself.
INTP|It is my inner conviction that the development of science seeks in the main to satisfy the longing for pure knowledge.
INTP|There was always with him a wonderful purity at once childlike and profoundly stubborn.
INTP|When a book was published entitled '100 Authors Against Einstein,' he retorted, 'If I were wrong, then one would have been enough!'
INTP|A scientific man ought to have no wishes, no affections - a mere heart of stone.
INTP|From my early youth I have had the strongest desire to understand or explain whatever I observed. ... To group all facts under some general laws.
INTP|I love fools' experiments. I am always making them.
INTP|Ignorance more frequently begets confidence than does knowledge.
INTP|If I am to constrain you by any law, it must be one by which I am also bound.
INTP|A ruler is merely the trustee of the rights of other men and he must always stand in dread of having in some way violated these rights.
INTP|He encouraged and greatly compelled his hearers to think for themselves; despotism was foreign to his disposition.
INTP|Thinking ... interrupts all doing, all ordinary activities no matter what they happen to be. ... The moment we start thinking ... we stop everything else.
INTP|If the ability to tell right from wrong should have anything to do with the ability to think, then we must be able to 'demand' its exercise in every sane person no matter how erudite or ignorant.
INTP|Nietzsche ... has caused philosophers so much confusion.
INTP|The business of thinking ... undoes every morning what it had finished the night before.
INTP|Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood.
INTP|I am among those who think that science has great beauty.
INTP|Be less curious about people and more curious about ideas.
INTP|Marie Curie is, of all famous people, the only one whom fame has not corrupted.
INTP|What worries me about religion is that it teaches people to be satisfied with not understanding.
INTP|My passion is for scientific truth. I don't much care about good and evil. ... I care about what's true.
INTP|I don't want to sound callous ... even if I have nothing to offer ... that doesn't mean that what anybody else has to offer is true.
INTP|I am almost pathologically afraid of indoctrinating children. ... It would be a 'Think for Yourself Academy.'
INTP|To love truth for truth's sake is ... the seed-plot of all other virtues.
INTP|Logic is the anatomy of thought.
INTP|Reading furnishes the mind only with materials of knowledge; it is thinking that makes what we read ours.
INTP|Religion, which ... ought most particularly elevate us, as rational creatures ... is that where men often appear most irrational, and more senseless than beasts.
INTP|Truth comes only from those ... who cultivate their reason.
INTP|In ... assemblies ... passion wrests the scepter from reason. Had every Athenian citizen been a Socrates, every Athenian assembly would still have been a mob.
INTP|As a framer and defender of the Constitution Madison had no peer.
INTP|Madison lived in his head and public speaking did not come naturally to him.
INTP|His contemporaries liked to say that if God was in the details of a law Madison was usually there to greet Him.
INTP|Madison loathed Hamilton and loved Jefferson above all.
INTP|Science is the great antidote to the poison of enthusiasm and superstition.
INTP|I endeavor to find the connecting principles of nature ... which bind together all ... disjointed objects. Principles introduce order into this chaos of jarring and discordant appearances.
INTP|To discover principles is to allay the tumult of the imagination, and to restore it ... to ... tranquility and composure.
INTP|I am a slow, a very slow workman. I do and undo everything I write at least half a dozen of times before I can be tolerably pleased with it.
INTP|There is not a line in 'The Wealth of Nations' that is not still applicable to this day.
INTP|It may indeed prove to be far the most difficult and not the least important task for human reason rationally to comprehend its own limitations.
INTP|My interest in political philosophy was rather casual until I met Hayek.
INTP|Hayek is amongst the top 2-3 of the all the people who ever influenced me.
INTP|'s '
INTP|I have learned more from Hayek than from any other living thinker, except perhaps Alfred Tarski - but not even excepting Russell.
INTP|To really understand something you've got to reduce it to its principles.
INTP|In every discipline, progress comes from people who make hypotheses, most of which turn out to be wrong, but all of which ultimately point to the right answer.
INTP|I'm much more interested in having people thinking about the ideas, rather than the person.
INTP|The proper role of government is exactly what John Stuart Mill said. ... The proper role of government is to prevent other people from harming an individual and not much else.
INTP|With my father it was simply taken for granted that what mattered was how good your arguments were, not who was making them.
INTP|Reason in man is rather like God in the world.
INTP|To Aquinas the senses are what we have in common with dumb animals. ... Our better part is the mind ... and its intellectual contemplation.
INTP|To Aquinas the intellect stands at the summit of ... the human soul.
INTP|Aquinas brought an Aristotelian view of reason back into European culture, and lighted the way toward the Renaissance.
INTP|St. Thomas is really a great man quite apart from his saintliness.
INTP|Cogito ergo sum.
INTP|Each problem that I solved became a rule, which served afterwards to solve other problems.
INTP|Descartes recommended that we distrust the senses and rely on the ... use of our intellect.
INTP|Descartes is justly regarded as the Father of Modern Philosophy. This is not because of the positive results of his investigations, which were few, but because of the questions ... and problems that he raised, problems that have still not been answered.
INTP|Descartes ... taught that the cause of error lies in the will, not the intellect.
INTP|Let reason alone decide.
INTP|It may be a historical fact that Parmenides is a kind of super-logician.
INTP|The thinking of later philosophers appears softer by comparison.
INTP|I have spoken to Einstein and he admitted to me that his theory was in fact no different from the one of Parmenides.
INTP|To interpret Parmenides as a Kant before Kant ... this is exactly what we must do.
INTP|It was high-minded Parmenides ... who introduced thought instead of imagination's deceit.
INTP|Few things are brought to a successful issue by impetuous desire, but most by calm and prudent forethought.
INTP|The bravest are surely those who have the clearest understanding of what is before them ... and yet notwithstanding, go out to meet it.
INTP|His insights into politics and war are universal and still relevant; his moral and psychological reflections on war and history are profound.
INTP|His book is considered to have laid the foundations of the discipline of history.
INTP|My style is somehow reflected in the Wikipedia style. A friend says it's a really good quality and also very infuriating that I'm so neutral all the time.
INTP|I think there is something to that, in fact to the point where I am not always comfortable being called a leader.
INTP|The description ... sounds distasteful to me.
INTP|He is, above all, a believer in reason.
INTP|My style is to absorb all the data I can to make the best-informed decision possible ... sometimes to the point of over-analysis.
INTP|I'm a stubbornly logical person.
INTP|Bill Gates and I soon found a groove together. I was the idea man. ... Bill listened and challenged me, and then homed in on my best ideas to help make them a reality. Our collaboration had a natural tension, but mostly it worked productively and well.
INTP|Bill would test my ideas. I would come to him with another 10 ideas that never went anywhere - he was the sanity check. But when it came to selling and marketing ... he was much more excited on the business side, so we became very complementary.
INTP|Building things ... is a really interesting intellectual exercise.
INTP|I find that pursuing truth is more important than trying to control people.
INTP|Part of our brand is that we're pretty understated.
INTP|Google is actually a great argument for doing pure research because we didn't start out to do a search engine at all.
INTP|Steve Jobs kept telling me, 'You're doing too much at once.'
INTP|Page is more interested ... in lots of weird side projects whereas Mark Zuckerberg is focused 100% on Facebook's core business, and has never seemed to waver from that.
INTP|I never rooted for my schools' sports teams. I was never one of the crowd supporting something or not. I like to maintain my independence.
INTP|Managing people, and being emotionally sensitive, and all the skills you learn in terms of communication and keeping people motivated - for me that has been a challenge.
INTP|Do you tell yourself 'I changed the world'?
INTP|When Sergey and I first met I thought he was pretty obnoxious. He had really strong opinions about things, and I guess I did, too.
INTP|The Google founders are two swords sharpening one another.
INTP|I could not ... write a serious romance except to save my life; and if I had to keep it up and not laugh at myself ... I am sure I should be hung before I had finished the first chapter.
INTP|She is really a sociologist and a historian, anatomizing the social and economic arrangements of her day.
INTP|Her chief tool is comic genius disguised as decorous panegyric or matter-of-fact description.
INTP|Jane Austen's irony is devastating in its exposure of foolishness and hypocrisy.
INTP|Both Jane Austen and Tina Fey turn their sharp tongues on the idiots around them and both view the world through a satirist's eyes.
INTP|I think that all writers feel alienated. ... I know that I do. ... I still feel, as I think most creative people do, absolutely isolated.
INTP|My novels introduce levels of intelligence ... moral doubt and self-doubt, which may not pertain to real-world espionage.
INTP|He doesn't attend book parties; he doesn't compete for, nor accept, book prizes. ... He dislikes book tours and interviews.
INTP|Readers who are mostly allergic to spy stories and genre narratives have long been drawn to le Carre ... because of the wit and incisiveness he manages to insert into pained understatement.
INTP|I had always viewed myself as an observer of events, never as a partaker of them.
INTP|I've never been entirely comfortable being cast as the person who calls the shots.
INTP|I'm hardly Adam Smith, but I've got the same inquisitiveness about understanding the broad forces that define our age.
INTP|I get so engaged when I have a problem I cannot solve, that I just cannot break away from what I am doing - I keep thinking and thinking and cannot stop.
INTP|There are things for which one is guilty even if one might offer excuses - simply because the crime is so overwhelming that by comparison any human excuse pales to insignificance.
INTP|Technology can be used to multiply genocide. ... The more technological the world becomes, the more essential ... individual freedom and the self-awareness of the individual human being will be as a counterpoise to technology.
INTP|For all writers of history, Eva Braun is going to be a disappointment.
INTP|I try to make things clear; I never try to make things deliberately ambivalent or cloudy.
INTP|I'm not looking in fear at science ... and worrying about where it's leading us. That's not the way I feel about it at all. I feel an incredible empathy for the process of science.
INTP|'Hehir: Cronenberg is a genuine intellectual. ... It'
INTP|He is a cheerful, deep-thinking, mild-mannered college professor type.
INTP|He is modest and in many ways ... his own worst critic.
INTP|I can't exist in normal group situations ... where you have to ... jockey for position. I ... just withdraw.
INTP|I became an actor through a series of really weird events. ... I don't think I ever would've tried to be an actor.
INTP|When acting, then there's a prescribed way to behave; whereas in life there's no prescribed way. So acting is a comfortable way to get through the day.
INTP|When I was acting in a play I liked knowing my place - that I was this role, and other people were that role, and we could interact with each other in a way I felt was very clear to me.
INTP|His characters usually have a few things in common. They're extremely bright and yet they often seem more than a little confused about what people around them expect, emotionally.
INTP|I didn't try to become a performer; it just happened when I was really young and then continued.
INTP|I've never thought of myself as being an actress or being a singer. I'm uncomfortable with both.
INTP|Everything that deals with being isolated I've felt very close to. ... Isolation is something ... that I understand well.
INTP|It's normal to judge yourself and to be your own worst critic. It keeps you in a kind of reality.
INTP|Self-questioning is my method.
INTP|In my youth I was very shy, very self-conscious. I didn't even decide to be an actress until people kept hiring me. I kind of backed into it.
INTP|I've always been drawn to women who aren't very comfortable in the world. Who are isolated.
INTP|Have I ever doubted myself? Have I ever not?
INTP|I feel self-doubt whether I'm doing something hard or easy.
INTP|Most directors didn't know what to do with me, so I ended up working with Ridley Scott and James Cameron. People who didn't much care for convention.
INTP|Comedy is only funny when it is telling the truth.
INTP|I live every writer's fantasy of being mostly a writer, but getting to be on TV just a little bit to get acknowledgment for being a writer.
INTP|Being a good boss means hiring talented people and then getting out of their way.
INTP|She doesn't belly-flop into the pool at the pool party. She watches everybody else's flops and then writes a play about it.
INTP|She's so bright you're always wondering if you're boring her.
INTP|The more I learned about the histories of organized religion, the more convinced I became that people are extremely gullible, and that I need to get off my ass and start a religion of my own!
INTP|I am one of the guys when it comes to gaming or computer skills, or even just all-around geekiness.
INTP|My hobbies include studying Wall Street and quantum physics.
INTP|I don't have a TV, and I don't party or socialize.
INTP|I am, by nature, a tourist everywhere I go, especially at home, and I spend much of my time and energy analyzing what I observe.
INTP|In my life, I am cursed ... by a habit of categorization. I see some examples, make a hypothesis based upon them, test that hypothesis, and if it works, I adopt it as a predictor and explainer of the human condition.
INTP|You are doing the classic post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy.
INTP|His past is actually tightly woven with higher education, academia, and law. In fact, his personal history reads much more like a tenured professor's than a former game-show host.
INTP|This is always a question for each singer to answer for himself. What do I stand for? What are my ideas? What am I doing?
INTP|Some people ask me: 'Don't you feel limited by only singing Renaissance and Baroque music?' Well, I reply that is most of the music till this very day!
INTP|I am German in the sense that Germans are known to be very self-critical and not too enthusiastic about themselves. ... We are not over-confident or praising ourselves too much.
INTP|I would like to see a world where nobody cared what anybody else was doing - in which ... group-think ... disappeared.
INTP|I find it very depressing to hear about situations in which competition and imitation rule creativity. I can't think of anything less important.
INTP|In my favorite music all of the extroversion, all of the superfluous excitement is gone.
INTP|All of the subjects that I've chosen have had to do with isolation. ... The whole idea of people gathering ... doesn't really appeal to me.
INTP|It feels completely inappropriate to try to persuade people to see my movies. It feels like lobbying for your own exam results.
INTP|I find it odd when people go, 'I worked very hard for this and I deserved it,' because lots of people work very hard and deserve things, so it seems somewhat self-aggrandizing, as though you have complete command over your destiny.
INTP|The way I got into acting was largely accidental.
INTP|I really like Matt Stone and Trey Parker's stuff. Anything they do is great.
INTP|Ayoade is big on suggesting that everything that's happened to him has happened by accident, or at least by default, never by design.
INTP|Noticing when the stoplights are in sync, or calculating the length of your strides between floor tiles - normal people notice that kind of stuff, but a certain kind of person will do some calculations.
INTP|I go to goth clubs dressed as a frat guy so I can stand around and look terribly uncomfortable. At frat parties I do the same thing, but the other way around.
ENTP|I have examined your position and determined your utterances to be mere brain-farts.
ENTP|I have never left off seeking after and learning every ... thing that I could.
ENTP|I go about Greece and ask my fellow Greeks difficult questions.
ENTP|It was Socrates who brought philosophy down from the heavens and onto the earth.
ENTP|Socrates was the eternal investigator of all things.
ENTP|Perche la minesstra si fredda.
ENTP|People of accomplishment rarely sit back and let things happen to them. They go out in the world and happen to things.
ENTP|It is a great fault ... to repeat the same movements, faces, manners. Why people do so has often been a source of wonder to me.
ENTP|A man ... should not fear to hear every opinion ... and consider it ... and respond to criticism with reasoning.
ENTP|He never completed any work he had begun.
ENTP|In my youth I was not content with being right but was ... rather insolent in a discussion. ... When someone asserted something ... I immediately showed some absurdity in his proposition.
ENTP|Debates should be conducted in the sincere spirit of inquiry after truth, without ... desire of victory.
ENTP|I was charmed by the Socratic method of debate and grew very artful and expert in drawing people ... into concessions and obtaining victories that I did not always deserve.
ENTP|Order ... with regard to places for things, papers, etc. I found extremely difficult to acquire. ... In truth I found myself incorrigible with respect to order.
ENTP|I have approximate answers and possible beliefs ... but I'm not absolutely sure of anything.
ENTP|On the many occasions when I play the bongo drums, the introducer never seems to find it necessary to mention that I also do theoretical physics.
ENTP|In the search for new laws, you always have the ... excitement of feeling that possibly nobody has yet thought of the crazy possibility you are looking at right now.
ENTP|Because of specialization ... the great problems ... have ... been discussed less and less in public. When we look at the past ... we feel jealous ... for we should have liked the excitement of such argument.
ENTP|Now now, my good man. This is no time for making enemies.
ENTP|Almost everything is imitation.
ENTP|To hold a pen is to be at war.
ENTP|It is dangerous to be right in matters where established men are wrong.
ENTP|Clever tyrants are never punished.
ENTP|The Quran is an unintelligible book, each page of which makes common sense shudder.
ENTP|To the quality of excellent language you add an infinity of other knowledge.
ENTP|Fortune is not as blind as people imagine. It is often the result of a long series of precise and well-chosen steps that precede events and are not perceived by the common herd.
ENTP|I am horribly curious.
ENTP|One should argue without anger or passion.
ENTP|There was no boy more daring than I.
ENTP|There is no one Catherine. ... Any synthesis of Catherine ... remains incomplete. In her memoirs Catherine herself is elusive even though her pleasant, direct tone invites us to see her as honest and sincere.
ENTP|Man must wear one face in public and another in private.
ENTP|Anyone who studies present and ancient affairs will easily see how in all cities and all peoples there still exist, and have always existed, the same tendencies.
ENTP|Occasionally words must serve to veil the facts. But let this happen in such a way that no one become aware of it.
ENTP|It is necessary to be a fox to discover snares and a lion to terrify wolves. Those who rely simply on the lion do not understand.
ENTP|Machiavelli presents the most serious events in a boisterous ... tempo of the gallop, and with the best, wantonest humor.
ENTP|I have written on all sorts of subjects and yet I have no enemies, except indeed all the Whigs, all the Tories and all the Christians.
ENTP|I cannot but consider myself as a kind of resident or ambassador from the dominions of learning to those of conversation.
ENTP|Hume was at once a philosopher and a darling of the Paris salons.
ENTP|Hume is not capable of concentrated attention. ... He seems to spin thoughts out of his own brain without any regard for religion or tradition.
ENTP|Everything's changing, everything's dynamic. ... You get this idea, and you get another idea, and this doesn't work out and you have to replace it with something else.
ENTP|All the best things that I did at Apple came from ... not having done it before, ever. Every single thing that we came out with that was really great, I'd never once done that thing in my life.
ENTP|Creative things have to sell to get acknowledged. ... Steve Jobs didn't really set the direction of my ... designs but he did the more important part of turning them into a product that would sell.
ENTP|Steve Jobs always saw a way to make a quick buck off my designs. ... The lofty talk came much further down the line.
ENTP|We have to remember that what we observe is not nature herself, but nature exposed to our method of questioning.
ENTP|I am so curious about everything new.
ENTP|Scientific progress calls for no more than the absorption and elaboration of new ideas - and this is a call most scientists are happy to heed.
ENTP|Even for the physicist his ability to explain his work in plain language will be the criterion of the degree of understanding that has been reached.
ENTP|Modern physics takes a definite stand against Democritus and for Plato.
ENTP|One should always be willing to carry on the discussion in the opponent's terminology.
ENTP|Since we can never know anything for sure, it is simply not worth searching for certainty.
ENTP|For me, both philosophy and science lose all their attraction when they become specialisms. ... Specialization may be a great temptation for the scientist. For the philosopher it is the mortal sin.
ENTP|The true Enlightenment thinker ... seeks not to convince but to arouse - to challenge others to form free opinions.
ENTP|The 'lofty depth' that Hegel ascribes to himself is an unmixed metaphor that works out to flatness.
ENTP|Do not fear to be eccentric in opinion, for every opinion now accepted was once eccentric.
ENTP|Marx was driven to change the world and I should say that my goal is the very opposite. My goal is to understand.
ENTP|This world is not something in which certainty is possible ... and therefore you must learn to act on things which you still very much doubt.
ENTP|Russell brought philosophy down to earth, with clarity and wit.
ENTP|Hume was merely the Bertrand Russell of his time.
ENTP|I never meant to say that the Conservatives are generally stupid. I meant to say that stupid people are generally Conservative.
ENTP|Stupidity is much the same all the world over. A stupid person's notions and feelings may confidently be inferred from those which prevail in his circle.
ENTP|The first intellectual operation in which I arrived at any proficiency, was dissecting a bad argument, and finding in what part the fallacy lay.
ENTP|As a boy I was disputatious, and did not scruple to give direct contradictions to things which I heard said.
ENTP|Mill had an allergy to dogma, including his own.
ENTP|The first emotion in the human mind is curiosity. ... Curiosity blends itself more or less with all our passions.
ENTP|Curiosity ... has an appetite which is very sharp, but very easily satisfied; and it has always an appearance of giddiness, restlessness, and anxiety.
ENTP|We are creatures designed for contemplation as well as action.
ENTP|In conversation, Burke's wit was felicitous.
ENTP|It is ironic that the father of conservatism was himself a man who wrote and spoke with such imaginative flair.
ENTP|No one ever poured forth such a flood of thought - so many original combinations of inventive genius ... all intermingled with the liveliest sallies of wit.
ENTP|Burkean conservatism is a fine application of reason.
ENTP|I'm not a natural leader. I'm too intellectual; I'm too abstract; I think too much.
ENTP|If I'm going to be president, we're going to make mistakes. You can't have change on the level I want and not make mistakes.
ENTP|I think Obama worked very hard at being a person who is normal, reasonable, moderate, bipartisan, transparent, accommodating - none of which was true. ... He was being the person he needed to be. ... He was authentically dishonest.
ENTP|Gingrich is very entertaining. ... He has a lot of knowledge and he comes up with some quite creative ideas.
ENTP|Gingrich is one of the smartest, most creative figures in politics. But he is also a bomb thrower who can be bombastic, erratic and an intellectual bully.
ENTP|In my Nobel Peace Prize speech I wanted to make an argument that didn't allow either side to feel too comfortable.
ENTP|As an adolescent I was arguing all the time, usually about me failing to abide by ... petty and arbitrary rules. I found that I could generally win these arguments.
ENTP|There are some things about being president that I still have difficulty doing. For example, faking emotion. Because I feel it is an insult to the people I'm dealing with.
ENTP|My wife makes fun of how routinized I've become. It's not my natural state. ... But at some point in my life I overcompensated.
ENTP|Obama is an intellectual. ... He's not a moralizer.
ENTP|To revolutionize society you certainly don't have to convince the majority of the public, because most of the public will follow anything that happens.
ENTP|John Stuart Mill was the quintessence of soft rather than hardcore, a woolly-minded man of mush.
ENTP|There is one good thing about Marx: He was not a Keynesian.
ENTP|In the long run we are all dead.
ENTP|He did not like to write more than once about any subject ... so each piece he wrote was new and fresh.
ENTP|We tend to think that a problem is either economic or political or military. ... It is hard for us to understand that we have to be able to do military, political, economic and psychological things, all simultaneously.
ENTP|He is ... soft and not sophisticated.
ENTP|He would squeeze me for my ideas the way one would squeeze a sponge.
ENTP|The Kissinger wit can always be counted on.
ENTP|Kissinger's furtive style and chameleon instincts make capturing his true colors difficult.
ENTP|The party elite is a bunch of zombies with a slave mentality. I want them to have more courage and determination.
ENTP|Mao was always in search of the new, the untested, the untried, both in his private life and in the affairs of the nation.
ENTP|Mao was interested in history and he used the stories of China's past both to understand and to manipulate the present.
ENTP|The stories about Mao do not match. ... Indeed, it is a theme: There are multiple Maos, and to settle on one dominant image is to distort the whole.
ENTP|I like talking and listening with a calm manner and a logical reasoning.
ENTP|I am worried at the thought that progress would be sacrificed for the stagnant mentality, action-dodging and conservatism of some people.
ENTP|What have the Zionists done ... that the U.S. administration feels obliged to blindly support them? Is it not because they have imposed themselves on ... the banking, financial, cultural and media sectors?
ENTP|Ahmadinejad is a personality of a different intellectual caliber, erudition ... and world outlook than his predecessors.
ENTP|He presents ideas drawn from a curiously mixed bag.
ENTP|My comedy is irreverent so that people not take their dogma too seriously.
ENTP|I'm not going to censor myself to comfort your ignorance.
ENTP|He can process and distill a vast, complex knowledge base into manageable, crystal-clear chunks.
ENTP|Everybody was always a little afraid of messing with Jon because he was so quick-witted.
ENTP|Jon Stewart is brilliant.
ENTP|Stewart deploys quite a high level of wit and possesses a mind that is elegant, not abusive.
ENTP|We need more people speaking out. This country is not overrun with rebels and free thinkers. It's overrun with sheep and conformists.
ENTP|I do think the patriotic thing to do is to critique my country. How else do you make a country better but by pointing out its flaws?
ENTP|I don't want to live in a country where no one ever says anything that offends anyone.
ENTP|If we take the spontaneity out of our discourse, we'll end up with people who never say anything but the safest, blandest, emptiest ... platitudes.
ENTP|'Borat' is not a joke on Kazahkstan. The joke is on the people who can believe that the Kazahkstan I describe can exist.
ENTP|He has no respect for sacred cows, political, religious, social, or otherwise.
ENTP|He is a brilliant satirist but when he was a student of mine he showed obvious academic potential. ... If only he had followed my advice, he could have been a serious historian.
ENTP|I've always been prepared to say what some people consider to be the 'unsayable.'
ENTP|I quite like the media hating me. ... Once they've shown signs of weakness you really can go for them.
ENTP|I've got no idea what makes cars work. If somebody told me to change the plugs, I'd be looking in the boot. I'm interested in what cars say about you, not what makes them work.
ENTP|He refuses to countenance any form of political correctness.
ENTP|I don't think I'm cynical. I'm skeptical.
ENTP|I like the idea of ... discovering new things all the time.
ENTP|I'm not ... pro- or anti-anything. ... I'm giving you the whole experience. Then you can decide for yourself.
ENTP|George Lucas and Steven Spielberg ... they only go so far, and their view of the world is rather simplistic.
ENTP|I'm trying to make people perceive the world in a different way. ... I don't want to reassure people. I want them to think and question the world they are living in. ... We live in a surreal world, and nobody notices it.
ENTP|Looking back on my education I started to get angry. I thought: 'Why was I given this rubbish? This tenth-rate series of platitudes?'
ENTP|My message is: 'Work it out for yourselves, you're all individuals, and don't do what people tell you to do.'
ENTP|Monty Python is a critique of closed systems of thought. ... Systems by which, whatever evidence is given to a person, he merely adapts it. ... Once ... no contrary evidence can come in, I think it is very dangerous.
ENTP|With regards to my criminal record I think I've been lucky, because my frequent appearances on Court TV have brought my fame to another level than 'just the actor guy.'
ENTP|I love change.
ENTP|Conversations with Robert Downey Jr. are rarely linear. ... Sometimes it takes a moment to realize how one thing might relate to the next.
ENTP|He's this incredible amalgam of contradictory traits that is never boring. He's completely eccentric ... and has a kind of never-grow-up quality.
ENTP|For me freedom of speech reigns just below the right to sustain life itself.
ENTP|It is appalling how prickly and intolerant society has become of even the mildest adverse comment.
ENTP|For me, the best way to increase society's resistance to insulting or offensive speech is to allow a lot more of it.
ENTP|Life itself has no plot!
ENTP|I need order around me because I am a transgressor.
ENTP|Freud forces us to think, Jung permits us to imagine, to dream.
ENTP|Reading Jung freed me from my guilt and inferiority which stemmed from my inability to organize.
ENTP|In Fellini's interviews he makes jokes and says preposterous things that you know he can't possibly mean.
ENTP|Everything I have not known before interests me more than everything I have seen in my life.
ENTP|I prefer to do all my work in the evening ... and then send everything in. I'm not even there in the studio. ... My work is very conceptual.
ENTP|I read 10 books at the same time. My favorite ... is Spinoza, but I have superficial books too, and magazines. ... I want to know everything. I want to see everything.
ENTP|Seriousness is no more a guarantee of truth ... than humor is a guarantee of superficiality.
ENTP|I like to wake up each morning and not know what I think, that I may reinvent myself in some way.
ENTP|I have always felt unable to ... become part of the tribe. ... I have always sniped or joked from the sidelines.
ENTP|Incuriosity is the oddest and most foolish failing there is.
ENTP|The worst kind of non-smokers are the ones that come up to you and cough. That's pretty cruel, isn't it? Do you go up to cripples and dance too?
ENTP|A lot of Christians ... wear crosses around their necks. Nice sentiment, but do you think when Jesus comes back he's really going to want to see a cross?
ENTP|I think it's important ... to not just use your same tricks over and over.
ENTP|I enjoy darker sardonic wit more than knock-knock jokes.
ENTP|I'm like a plate-spinner. ... I've got a lot of little plates that I'm trying to keep spinning at the same time.
ENTP|He is a particular personality type: the nerd extrovert.
ENTP|Never believe anything that anyone tells you. This advice is not as cynical as it sounds; it's just that ... you can't take things at face value.
ENTP|I grew up on 'Monty Python'. ... And they just went straight to the core of everything I hold dear as an actor, as a comedian, everything. It was just right up my alley.
ENTP|I maintain a sense of play and creativity and spontaneity.
ENTP|Growing up I knew I was funny.
ENTP|I don't have many answers, just questions.
ENTP|I like not falling back on the same stuff.
ENTP|Keep your mind open to possibilities and your mouth closed on matters that you don't know about.
ENTP|I thrive on the feeling of being able to create your day on the move.
ENTP|I always knew that I could land a joke if I needed to.
ENTP|My characters are really bizarre. They're dark and not really considered great people. It all comes from the same dark place inside me - it's just filtered through comedy.
ENTP|To get to do whatever I want and not to have to answer to anyone - there's something joyful about that.
ENTP|In school I was ... busy talking, insulting teachers and generally playing the clown.
ENTP|I'm a more spontaneous person than my 'X-Files' character. I laugh. I'm crass. I'm raunchy!
ENTP|I think everybody has sexual tension with David.
ENTP|It's good to have a conversation about two different opinions. Always having multiple opinions is a good thing, because then you can have a conversation and learn something from the conversation.
ENTP|My favorite types of playwrights all ... play with ambiguity and not having all the answers in their stories.
ENTP|As a kid I really loved ... Michelle Pfeiffer. I was completely in love with her.
ENTP|I love the way Josh Radnor writes. There is a style to it and it's intelligent and funny.
ENTP|I keep waiting to meet a man who has more balls than I do.
ENTP|It's hard to put me in a box. ... I am so many things.
ENTP|Film studios want a girl to come in and be quiet ... and do as they say. ... It's just not in my nature.
ENTP|Try to contain her in a box, and she'll lift off the lid, rise up, and just soar away every single time.
ENTP|Her candor, her honesty, her boldness, her fire - it all made me want to be more truthful with myself.
ENTP|Why should I downplay myself to make someone else more comfortable?
ENTP|In school I would sit and argue with the teachers and take up everybody's time.
ENTP|Howard Stern said to me: 'You're just too much work.' ... But it's not like I'm trying to be challenging. I just think people get used to a diet of beige and they can't handle it when something shocking ... comes along.
ENTP|I always thought I was more satanic than Manson.
ENTP|I like looking at everything from the perspective that you normally don't get to see. That fascinates me.
ENTP|I like to do everything incredibly hastily.
ENTP|I love Feynman. I would really have liked to have a beer with him. ... I don't know that I'd have had anything specific to ask Feynman, I just have this feeling that we would've gotten along really well.
ENTP|When I met Daniel Dennett we mind-melded for 45 minutes solid. It was fantastic.
ENTP|I have an urge to explore, to create movement, to go faster and faster, and maybe find some kind of peace at the heart of it, a state of pure being.
ENTP|Fellini opened up new realms of possibility for me.
ENTP|He is ... a torrent of ideas and insights.
ENTP|Everything about the man is quick.
ENTP|I'd been acting for a long time and I was really tired of it. I was restless, and a little bored, and I was really eager to investigate different parts of myself.
ENTP|She exhibits a wacky charm and a swift, playful mind.
ENTP|She has a quick mind ... and a highly attuned sense of wordplay that surfaces again and again.
ENTP|'s Bazaar: When she isn'
ENTP|Most films are pretentious nonsense or commercial schlock.
ENTP|I rather hate acting. ... I cling to the fantasy that I could have done something more creative, like writing a book. But ... I don't have the discipline.
ENTP|I'm much happier ad-libbing than delivering scripted lines. Much better. Much freer.
ENTP|In person he doesn't reveal much about himself, but he is so entertaining that it doesn't matter.
ENTP|He's very witty company. I've always found him bright, and he's a fantastic raconteur: he's wicked. He's not like his 'Notting Hill' persona at all.
ENTP|The Western way of singing is very predictable.
ENTP|Punk has become so diluted because there's nothing being generated that's new; it's just recycled.
ENTP|I like ... working in a ... spontaneous environment.
ENTP|A lot of the time you can finish other artists' sentences. 'That's obvious. That's obvious.' It's always obvious.
ENTP|I didn't want to make anything obvious. I wanted to surprise the listener.
ENTP|I'm always motivated to try something new. I don't want to do the same thing over and over and over again.
ENTP|I have a restless spirit and that motivates me to always look for new forms of inspiration.
ENTP|It's easy for me to get really irritated with the world and think that I'm surrounded by moronic people.
ENTP|The No. 1 thing is my resentment of ... group-think mentality.
ENTP|When you're trying to send a message to someone, if you wrap it in humor it sticks a lot better. It's like the sugar with the medicine. People remember things when they laugh.
ENTP|I've got pissing people off down to a science.
ENTP|I get compared to Bill Hicks.
ENTP|My favorite example of the wrong kind of criticism is when someone says, 'It doesn't feel right.'
ENTP|Inspiration isn't something you can schedule, harness, or control.
ENTP|I'm pretty good at arguing, so maybe I would've been a lawyer. I'm not inspired by lawyers - I just know how well I argue with my family members.
ENTP|Nikola Tesla was the greatest geek who ever lived.
ENTP|The only thing Edison truly pioneered was douchebaggery.
ENTP|I can't imagine ... working with somebody who's very politically correct. It would be disastrous.
ENTP|Life is funny, and it's depressing. At the same time.
ENTP|She comes off as candid and witty as her characters.
ENTP|I like ... a band shedding its skin every time there's a new record to be made. I wish more bands would do that.
ENTP|The name Volta is taken from a Federico Fellini book about his films.
ENTP|I'm very much like my character Chandler, with the funny one-liners.
ENTP|To be a comedian, you have to have some darkness behind it.
ENTP|Being on autopilot is the worst thing possible.
ESTP|There is nothing impossible to him who will try.
ESTP 'untrainable'
ESTP|I won over enemies by making them friends and then obligated them to me through benefaction.

ISFP|Abhorring show, Grant was simple in manner, gentle in his intercourse, modest and even diffident in regard to his own personality.
ISFP|Grant was an innocent. ... He was not like any other president.
ISFP|Unlike most presidents, Grant ... preferred simply to go his own way rather than be a leader.
ISFP|I think we are surrounded by multiple, multiple products that testify to companies who don't really care.
ISFP|I'm constantly haunted by thoughts of, 'Is it good enough? Is there any way we could have made it better?'
ISFP|He is a consummate designer on all levels, especially around form, detail, materials and refinement.
ISFP|He's the nicest, politest guy you ever met and very softly spoken.
ISFP|He hasn't got where he is because of his ego.
ISFP|He is incredibly self-effacing.
ISFP|' wife: Most people in Steve'
ISFP|The most important thing to me is humility. My buildings should adapt to their surroundings, not impose themselves on the world.
ISFP|My architecture is treating space like music.
ISFP|One day, Utzon came into the office pretending to be Frank Lloyd Wright.
ISFP|Just pretend that you are the happiest person in the world.
ISFP|During the Vietnam war we young Buddhists ... were able to understand the suffering of both sides. ... That is why we did not take a side even though the whole world took sides.
ISFP|During the war we young buddhists tried to tell people our perception of the situation. ... We wanted to stop the fighting, but the bombs were so loud.
ISFP|Hanh's goal was peace and reconciliation, not one side winning over the other.
ISFP|Qualis artifex pereo!
ISFP|Augustus and Caesar had learned to feign interest in the theater and the circus. ... Nero did not need to feign interest.
ISFP|Nero excelled ... in the elegant arts of music and poetry and we should not despise his persuits.
ISFP|The people loved Nero. ... There is a reason for this which history omits. ... Nero never burdened the ordinary people. But Tacitus says nothing of this. He only speaks of his crimes. ... We, as a result, feel that Tacitus is biased.
ISFP|I was a dreamy child.
ISFP|As long as I live, I will say yes to life.
ISFP|I naturally prefer and capture the beauty in life.
ISFP|Reality doesn't interest me.
ISFP|I seek a style in the realm of legend. Something that might allow me to give free rein to my juvenile sense of romanticism and the beautiful image.
ISFP|The conscience of a moral personality is a far greater protection against the misuse of an office than is the supervision of parliament or the separation of powers.
ISFP|Being true ... means being modest and unassuming.
ISFP|Hess did not have the qualities necessary for survival in the midst of a swamp of intrigues and struggles for power. He was too sensitive, too receptive.
ISFP|Hess was a moody introvert.
ISFP|I am normally shy. But once I get up on stage, I take control of myself. Being onstage is magic. There's nothing like it.
ISFP|I'm crazy about Steven Spielberg.
ISFP|Diana was my type for sure, and I don't like most girls.
ISFP|He is a very kind person.
ISFP|He had real vision for his show. All the decisions he made were based on ... body and movement. I realized ... that all of his music is based on physical ideas. They'd be working through something, and he would explain ... with his body. That was really educational.
ISFP|You gotta live life before you can really talk too much about it.
ISFP|I don't live in a prison. I am not afraid of anything. I haven't built any walls around myself.
ISFP|I want to be able to walk around and be me. That's all I want to be, that's all I ever tried to be.
ISFP|I think Prince is a great artist. ... Prince has been overlooked. ... I've seen great performances by Prince. He's outperformed almost everyone. I'd rate him at the top.
ISFP|I just write them. There isn't any big message.
ISFP|You can't be wise and in love at the same time.
ISFP|I don't know if I call myself a poet or not. ... It's more of a visual type of thing for me. I could picture the color of the song.
ISFP|I don't ever try to make a serious social comment. ... It's just a song.
ISFP|How I wrote depended on my mood. The only way I would be sort of biting ... like John Lennon was if I was in a bad mood!
ISFP|Paul is very nice and easy to get on with - didn't have John Lennon's acerbic side.
ISFP|In the beginning Brian ran the band. He really wanted to be called the leader of the band. I didn't particularly want to be the leader. There wasn't a leader.
ISFP|John Lennon was educated and very smart and cynical and funny. ... But you always knew with John, you're gonna be on the end of a lot of sarcastic remarks that you weren't always in the mood for.
ISFP|I was never crazy about Kurt Cobain and Nirvana - too angst-ridden for me.
ISFP|Mick really has his own style, and he is quite opinionated about how he wants to look.
ISFP|Mick is difficult to interview, not only because of his natural reserve and lack of interest in the past but also because he communicates as much with his ... body ... as he does verbally: Half of what he says never makes it to the page.
ISFP|I don't think I'm cool. It's other people that tell me I'm cool. I'm just being who I am.
ISFP|Just be yourself is all I can say. ... If you've gotta think about being cool, you ain't cool.
ISFP|For myself and Mick songwriting is a matter of, almost, necessity.
ISFP|Mick and I are still great friends and still want to work together. Both of us know things about each other - and are still finding out. There is no final judgment on one or the other.
ISFP|People ... have to rely on music to get peace of mind, satisfaction, or direction. More so than politics, the big ego scene. Politics is an art of words ... meaning nothing. ... You ... have to rely on an earthier substance, like music or the arts.
ISFP|I just want to do what I feel.
ISFP|I like music that is easier on the mind. There are too many heavy songs nowadays. Music ... has been getting too heavy, almost to the state of unbearable.
ISFP|No one told me he was that fucking good.
ISFP|He is unable to conform to military rules and regulations.
ISFP|I really like the idea of my work speaking for me, not me speaking for me.
ISFP|People's preconceptions of me don't concern me. I am who I am. ... People's conceptions of what I am - in a way that's their problem and not mine.
ISFP|I feel strongly about what I want in my work and how I want to see it presented. It is an expression of me at some point, and it seems wrong that as soon as it goes out into the world it should leave me and my expression behind.
ISFP|My music expresses how I feel for me. There, in the chords and melodies, is everything I want to say. The words just jolly it along.
ISFP|I had to resign myself, many years ago, that I'm not too articulate when it comes to explaining how I feel about things.
ISFP|My music has always been my way of expressing what for me is inexpressible by any other means.
ISFP|How I love David Bowie!
ISFP|You have to be unique and different and shine in your own way.
ISFP|I try to not focus on what people expect from me.
ISFP|I'm half living my life between reality and fantasy at all times.
ISFP|Every bit of me is devoted to love and art.
ISFP|Embrace the things that make you unique, love yourself, and redefine what it means to be beautiful.
ISFP|I will never ever suppress who I am for anyone.
ISFP|When you go on stage, it's like you're in your own world, in a different world.
ISFP|I am not even going to talk with anyone in the music industry if they are not supportive. ... Taking away my creative freedom is like chopping out my soul.
ISFP|I am sometimes written off as aloof or stand-offish when I'm really shy and don't know what to say.
ISFP|When I did 'Head Like a Hole' that was how I felt in my head. When I did 'Downward Spiral' that is where I was for that. I try not to be too concerned about ... what people are expecting from me.
ISFP|What is the significance of the name 'Nine Inch Nails?'
ISFP|Every relationship I've been in, I've overwhelmed the girl. They just can't handle all the love.
ISFP|I feel very fortunate to be compared to somebody so incredible. Michael Jackson's an icon.
ISFP|My biggest challenge was to make sure that the songs I did were who I am.
ISFP|When I'm trying to make a song ... I'm trying to make a photograph out of something you can never see.
ISFP|My aim is to make something that represents where I am at that time.
ISFP|It's pretty rad to hear Beyonce sing a song of yours or to hear Jay-Z rhyme over and be on a song that you're on.
ISFP|I have a hard time with morals. All I know is what feels right. What's more important to me is being honest about who you are.
ISFP|I trust actions. I don't put much trust in words.
ISFP|My frustration with acting is that I can't do quite what music does. Music has its own language.
ISFP|I go a little insane with buying furniture. It's my thing.
ISFP|I've found that the best things always happen when you throw yourself into a situation and you don't know what you're doing. If you take too much control over it, it can become dank and moldy - no bubbles.
ISFP|I am pretty much mush. ... I wish I could be tougher.
ISFP|I have my own taste, and I just try and stick with that.
ISFP|If I have any particular appeal to women ... it's because I listen more than other guys do and appreciate how they think and feel about things.
ISFP|Show me a man that wouldn't give it all up for Emma Stone, and I'll show you a liar.
ISFP|Ryan has a wonderful gift for design, especially clothes - much better than I.
ISFP|Ryan likes detail in how he looks and how he dresses. He builds his character a lot through his wardrobe.
ISFP|I really like hearing Ryan Gosling's viewpoint because I know that it's never going to be tainted. He's very much his own person.
ISFP|I think life is all about ... children and flowers.
ISFP|I never think of myself as an icon. What is in other people's minds is not in my mind. I just do my thing.
ISFP|I've always followed my instincts and they've brought me nothing but blessings and good fortune and terribly kind people to work with.
ISFP|Audrey was meek, gentle and ethereal, understated both in her life and in her work. She walked among us with a light pace, as if she didn't want to be noticed.
ISFP|I've always admitted that I'm ruled by my passions.
ISFP|Michael Jackson and I had so much in common and we had such loving fun together.
ISFP|My acting process is very difficult to explain. It's something very intimate, very private.
ISFP|Acting is not words.
ISFP|I'm not scared of nudity, because for me, nothing is more beautiful than a body. You can have such an amazing emotion from a body.
ISFP|What interests me most is love. People who fall in love. Fall out of love. Hopefully we can survive, and that is what my films say.
ISFP|I was a highly sensitive child.
ISFP|I am really spontaneous.
ISFP|I love the beauty of clothes. I collect antique clothes.
ISFP|I have no sense of what's fashionable; I just know what I like to wear.
ISFP|I like sticking to my own self.
ISFP|Being in love is incredibly raw, incredibly dangerous and you're very much out at sea. You're exposed. You could drown.
ISFP|I lead from the heart, not the head.
ISFP|I don't go by a rule book.
ISFP|She loved dancing so much. It was a real way that she got through life - by dancing. ... It was a big release for her.
ISFP|She was very kind, very loving, very sweet.
ISFP|I have too many fantasies to be a housewife. I guess I am a fantasy.
ISFP|I restore myself when I'm alone.
ISFP|A sex symbol becomes a thing. I'd just hate to be a thing.
ISFP|I'm not sure why, but I identify with her.
ISFP|I don't like defining myself. I just am.
ISFP|Justin Timberlake just understands. I get him, and he gets me.
ISFP|When performing, Britney demands a framed photo of ... Princess Diana backstage. ... Diana is in many ways her inspiration.
ISFP|I'm very easy to get along with.
ISFP|When I was little I looked up to Princess Diana.
ISFP|Fashion, fun, excitement. ... I am really passionate.
ISFP|When you were in jail did you hear a lot about what people were saying on the outside?
ISFP|The label didn't want me to do this look. I don't care who likes it - this is me.
ISFP|The hardest thing for me is to say no.
ISFP|I've never watched an entire episode of 'American Idol.' It's too mean.
ISFP|I stray away from the formulaic, the formatted.
ISFP|I think you can really gauge my state of mind by listening to my albums.
ISFP|I'm not a judgmental person.
ISFP|It's so easy to get bulldozed by others.
ISFP|I'm ... very clear on who I am and what I like and don't like.
ISFP|I've written every single song on all my records, and that's really important because then they're me.
ISFP|I have to fight to keep my image really me. ... I rejected some gorgeous publicity shots because they just didn't look like me.
ISFP|I love having fun and I'm young at heart ... I love to enjoy life and live in the moment.
ISFP|When you are having a special moment ... it's all about making the best of it and losing yourself in that moment, being carefree.
ISFP|I'm not a loud, extravagant person. ... I don't show off or boast.
ISFP|I was asked to make a record that would not have been true to myself. ... I cannot make music that does not speak to my soul.
ISFP|I've stayed true to myself and I've followed what my heart says is right.
ISFP|I don't find it easy to express my feelings in words.
ISFP|I thought Roger Waters' songs were very wordy and that ... the music that he wrote became a mere vehicle for lyrics, and not a very inspiring one.
ISFP|How did Roger Waters become the leader of Pink Floyd?
ISFP|I am really a very shy person. If I do publicity, it is because of the music, not because I want to be seen.
ISFP|My core beliefs revolve around the idea that ... we should live and let live.
ISFP|Before performing I walk around the theater and imagine ... what it's like to sit in the audience. I have to go into the lobby; I have to get a sense of the experience.
ISFP|I find it boring when lyrics are dark and brooding.
ISFP|I got out of ... classical music because I wanted a more comfortable, enjoyable, social-music atmosphere.
ISFP|Dylan just reminded us to not get too uptight.
ISFP|When I am writing music, it is magical. I don't know why I write songs, I don't know where it comes from and I don't know why I am doing it.
ISFP|Reporters want to know why I sing like this, why do I use a bow on my guitar. ... I really don't know. And I can't make something up about it. I can only speak the truth.
ISFP|It takes a big toll on me ... that there's a business side of the music industry that has nothing to do with writing songs and creating music.
ISFP|I am so spontaneous ... and everything I do has a huge amount of soul, but no meaning.
ISFP|All I can control is my response to input. If you come around me and tell me bad news all the time, I can say, 'You know what? I don't want to hear it.'
ISFP|Dancing's part of my soul. I enjoy it, it makes people happy, and it makes me happy.
ISFP|I'm a big mush ball, which is just part of my personality.
ISFP|I'll never try to put on a fake image. I'm just Zac.
ISFP|I don't judge anyone and I never have.
ISFP|Every day is a new experience and I take it as it comes.
ISFP|Nicole Kidman is fun to work with. ... When we were acting together we went with the moment.
ISFP|I love football. I love being in front of that crowd performing. I think that's where I feel safest, actually, believe it or not.
ISFP|I'm a big fan of tattos. Each one has a meaning.
ISFP|I've always loved clothes and liked to dress up.
ISFP|I've never wanted to be a manager. It's not a passion of mine.
ISFP|I'm superopinionated about what I do and don't like.
ISFP|Acting isn't for me. I don't like being told what to do. I'm more interested in ... design, more visually driven.
ISFP|She's very feminine. ... She loves fashion and music and art and film, and she is able to combine them in a way that all seems natural. I'm sure she works quite hard, but it all seems effortless.
ISFP|She doesn't have that gritty hunger to prove what she knows.
ISFP|You want to protect her. She sees the world a certain way, and you don't want the world to let her down.
ISFP|There is no definition of beauty, but when you can see someone's spirit coming through, something unexplainable, that's beautiful to me.
ISFP|Love is the hardest habit to break, and the most difficult to satisfy.
ISFP|Tattoos are like stories - they're symbolic of the important moments in your life. Sitting down, talking about where you got each tattoo and what it symbolizes, is really beautiful.
ISFP|A common misperception about me is that I can't possibly be shy and do what I do. I have confidence about certain things and not about others.
ISFP|I'd rather be naked in a room of 300 people than talking in front of them.
ISFP|There's a lot of jargon that's a bunch of horseshit. I just like what I like.
ISFP|As an artist you just go with your heart. ... That's pretty much the goal of any artist, I think: To follow his heart.
ISFP|Everything happens for a reason, no matter if it's good or bad. There is no point in trying to change it.
ISFP|People should just hear the title of an album and go out and ... experience it for themselves. ... You shouldn't really have to explain it. You should be able to hear it, and it either moves you or it doesn't.
ISFP|The key moments in a performance are when you're singing and going back to the place where you wrote those lyrics. ... You're actually feeling where it came from.
ISFP|I wouldn't say I'm a heavy guy. I just feel what I feel.
ISFP|I never try to overthink things.
ISFP|Wherever you are, different places, different people - you've just got to roll with it.
ISFP|It tripped me up because to me, she is just granny, but to all these countries, she is the queen.
ISFP|William is dutiful and proper while Harry is volatile and carefree.
ISFP|Harry's the naughty one, just like me.
ISFP|I often choose to perceive the light of a new day as the rebirth of the untouched, the inexperienced and the innocent.
ISFP|It is wonderful to pretend that everything begins anew each day.
ISFP|It was my own will to sort of shape my life that way, being physically active and challenging yourself in that sense. ... That's sort of my destiny.
ISFP|I like people who have their own quirky style.
ISFP|I try to be ... soulful and ... true to real life.
ISFP|I'm a bit of a dreamer. I don't really have any boundaries. If I want something, I chase after it.
ISFP|You either can write a song or you can't. It just comes out somehow.
ISFP|With any art there are no rules.
ISFP|She furthers the idea of non-conformity ... and not boxing herself in for future pursuits.
ISFP|Sometimes you've just got to put your pride aside and be quiet so that you can absorb not only what a person is saying but how they are saying it - their energy, their body language. It's all for a reason.
ISFP|I am a sensitive person, so I want to be with sensitive people.
ISFP|Fashion and music are like time and space. Without time there is no space ... without fashion there is no music. What are you going to wear in your video? What are you going to listen to going down the runway? It's the same thing.
ISFP|His personal bible is Paulo Coelho's 'The Alchemist.'
ISFP|He is a visual person, a kind of intelligence that isn't celebrated in most schools.
INFP|My heart is at once haughty and tender and my character effeminate, yet invincible.
INFP|When under stress I thought of the books I had read and applied them to myself. I imagined I was one of the characters and soon found myself in made-up circumstances which were most agreeable to my inclinations.
INFP|Reason is greatly indebted to passion. The human race would long since have ceased to be, had its preservation depended only on reason.
INFP|To pace about, looking to obtain status, looking to attain 'importance' - I can think of nothing more ridiculous.
INFP|Whatever you do, never lose your fondness of walking. I walk myself into my daily well-being, and I walk out of all illness. I have walked myself into my best thoughts, and I know of no thought so heavy that one cannot outwalk it.
INFP|Physicists, by and large, are Platonists who seek reality in the archetypes behind the scenes. Non-scientists, by and large, are Kierkegaardians for whom the subjectivity of life and thought is more real than scientific models.
INFP|We used to wonder where war lived, what it was that made it so vile. And now we realize that we know where it lives: Inside ourselves.
INFP|Nobody realizes that some people expend tremendous energy merely to be normal.
INFP|To be happy, we must not be too concerned with others.
INFP|While Sartre could separate the world of ideas from his personal friendship, Camus ... believed friendship was essential and united people together in the struggle for a better world.
INFP|I had the lonely child's habit of making up stories and holding conversations with imaginary persons.
INFP|From ... the age of five or six, I knew that when I grew up I should be a writer. ... I tried to abandon this idea, but I did so with the consciousness that I was outraging my true nature and that sooner or later I should have to settle down and write books.
INFP|What I have most wanted to do ... is to make political writing into an art. My starting point is always a feeling of partisanship, a sense of injustice.
INFP|Politically I would describe myself as a 'conservative Trotskist.'
INFP|I am a mere individual ... with intense feelings more than ideas.
INFP|It is difficult for me to say anything about my work without saying too much: the attempt to say a few words opens a floodgate of excitement.
INFP|The most improper job of any man ... is bossing other men. Not one in a million is fit for it, and least of all those who seek the opportunity.
INFP|I often long to work at my nonsense fairy language and don't let myself 'cause though I love it so it does seem such a mad hobby!
INFP|C.S. Lewis was for long my only audience. Only from him did I ever get the idea that my 'stuff' could be more than a private hobby.
INFP|There is in me ... a distaste for all that is public, all that belongs to the collective.
INFP|I have a boorish inaptitude for formality.
INFP|It is ridiculous to be concerned about being grown up and to admire the grown up because it is grown up.
INFP|Friendship arises ... when two people discover that they have in common some ... interest or taste ...which, till that moment, each believed to be his own unique treasure.
INFP|When C.S. Lewis got his first look at Tolkien's fiction ... he reacted with spontaneous and generous delight.
INFP|My own brain is to me the most unaccountable of machinery - always buzzing, humming, soaring roaring diving, and then buried in mud. And why? What's this passion for?
INFP|The art of writing is imagining that one is not oneself, but somebody different.
INFP|Each has his past shut in him like the leaves of a book known to him by his heart, and his friends can only read the title.
INFP|The eyes of others are our prisons; their thoughts our cages.
INFP|If you do not tell the truth about yourself you cannot tell it about other people.
INFP|There's a time ... to be totally in quiet listening mode when somebody else's mind is open to you.
INFP|Never start a war. ... The USA should only go to war because we have to. And if you live by that guidance, you'll never have veterans throwing away their medals or standing up in protest.
INFP|Once you get to know him he is really a warm and open and funny human being.
INFP|No one can tell him what to do. You can suggest it, and maybe he'll do it and maybe he won't. But he is not going to surrender that personal autonomy that is the core of his integrity.
INFP|Destroy him before he becomes another Ralph Nader.
INFP|One sees well only with the heart. What is essential is invisible to the eye.
INFP|If you want to build a ship, don't drum up the men to gather wood, divide the work and give orders. Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea.
INFP|From his wife I learned that his preoccupation with flight was really an act of evasion, an attempt to escape from the world.
INFP|Even now when I see my name in the paper, I feel that the world is intruding unduly on my privacy. I ought to be anonymous.
INFP|Sarcasm, directed into the blue in the hope of hitting the person you want, may not be effective, but it does relieve the feelings.
INFP|There are people who keep thermometers shut up indoors, which is both cruel and unnecessary. When you complain that the library is a little chilly ... they look at the thermometer ... and say, 'Oh no; I don't think so. It's sixty-five.' As if anybody wanted a thermometer to know if a room were cold or not.
INFP|Doing everything myself kept the strip very honest and personal - everything having to do with Calvin and Hobbes expressed my own ideas, my own values, my own way.
INFP|I was not prepared for the ... attention that comes with being famous. ... Besides disliking the diminishment of privacy and the inhibiting quality of feeling watched. ... I didn't see how I could write honestly without seclusion.
INFP|Weekends don't count unless you spend them doing something completely pointless.
INFP|The wizards represent all that the normal person most fears: They are plainly outcasts and comfortable with being so.
INFP|Nothing is more unnerving to the truly conventional than the unashamed misfit!
INFP|Unlike any other creature on this planet, humans can ... think themselves into other people's places.
INFP|You can achieve nothing if you forsake yourself.
INFP|In this love you are like a knife, with which I explore myself.
INFP|We humans are as forlorn as children lost in the woods.
INFP|People are quite different. What grips me need hardly touch you at all. ... What is innocence in you may be guilt in me. ... What has no consequences for you may be the last nail in my coffin.
INFP|Growing up, my father asserted that I had no business sense, that I had lofty ideas in my head, and the like.
INFP|You do not need to leave your room. ... Simply ... be quiet and the world will freely offer itself to you. ... It has no choice.
INFP|They who dream by day are cognizant of many things which escape those who dream only by night.
INFP null
INFP|Science has not yet taught us if madness is or is not the sublimity of the intelligence.
INFP|With me poetry has not been a purpose, but a passion.
INFP|Everything about him suggests introversion, self-immersion, mood, mystery. Everything suggests a man seeking his own soul.
INFP|He who reigns within himself and rules passions, desires, and fears is more than a king.
INFP|Let truth and falsehood grapple. ... Truth is strong.
INFP|The mind is its own place, and in itself can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven.
INFP|A truth that's told with bad intent beats all the lies you can invent.
INFP|To generalize is to be an idiot. To particularize is the alone distinction of merit - general knowledges are those knowledges that idiots possess.
INFP|When I tell any truth it is not for the sake of convincing those who do not know it but for the sake of defending those who do.
INFP|All deities reside in the human breast.
INFP|The good man, though a slave, is free; the wicked, though he reigns, is a slave, and not the slave of a single man, but - what is worse - the slave of as many masters as he has vices.
INFP|God did not intend that man should have power over his fellow man.
INFP|Augustine ... did not materialize with a fixed doctrine but spent his life struggling towards some kind of personal truth.
INFP|Some good must come by clinging to what is right.
INFP|Aren't the wise ones, those who never do anything foolish, even more foolish?
INFP|What a mystery life is; and love is a mystery within a mystery.
INFP|My existence is not without reason! I know that I could be a quite different person! ... There is something inside me, but what can it be?
INFP|For my part I know nothing with any certainty, but the sight of the stars makes me dream.
INFP|My God, how beautiful Shakespeare is. ... His language and method are like a brush trembling with excitement and ecstasy.
INFP|If you looked down to the bottom of my soul, you would understand fully the source of my longing and - pity me.
INFP|Even the open, transparent lake has its unknown depths.
INFP|The whole world is a series of miracles, but we're so used to them we call them ordinary things.
INFP|His novels stand in such a physical relationship to his own self that their conception is not so much a production as it is an amputation.
INFP|Throughout his life he remained an outsider, and it was probably this that enabled him to empathize with many of the losers who appear in his stories.
INFP|To thine own self be true.
INFP|Shakespeare hits upon a striking peculiarity of sentiment, adapted uniquely to each character ... as if by inspiration.
INFP|The verbal poetical texture of Shakespeare is the greatest the world has known.
INFP|The blade itself incites to violence.
INFP|Hateful to me ... is that man who hides one thing in his heart and speaks another.
INFP|Evidently, what fascinates Homer about ... language is not its instrumental precision but its descriptive richness.
INFP|For while Homer handles irrationalities, he disguises them behind other good qualities, so as to allow them to exist. ... This is the excellence of Homer's style.
INFP|Philologists who use their knowledge to pick Homer apart practice a learned barbarism.
INFP|Goethe was a genius who fought a battle with himself to try and surpass the genius of Homer.
INFP|In my imagination, I can come up with anything that I want. I can make things very large and very colorful.
INFP|My own heroes are the dreamers, those ... who tried to make the world a better place. ... Some failed ... but it is the effort that's heroic, as I see it.
INFP|The horrors of human history derive not from orcs and Dark Lords, but from within ourselves. We are the monsters, and the heroes too. Each of us has it within himself.
INFP|Tolkien has been a huge influence on me.
INFP|No one thinks like this guy. ... Reading him you go: ... 'How did that ... ever come into anybody's head?' George's stuff is fluid and funky, weird and kinky, but also ... profound with weight and import.
INFP|If everyone demanded peace instead of another television set, then there'd be peace.
INFP|Either I'm a genius or I'm mad, which is it? ... I can't be mad because nobody's put me away; therefore I'm a genius. ... If there's such a thing as genius - I am one. And if there isn't, I don't care.
INFP|Reality leaves a lot to the imagination.

INFP|In society you trade in your reality for a role. You trade in your senses for an act. You give up your ability to feel and in exchange, put on a mask.
INFP|There can't be any large-scale revolution until there's a personal revolution, on an individual level. It's got to happen inside first.
INFP|I knew I was different. I thought that I might be gay or something because I couldn't identify with any of the guys at all. None of them liked art or music, they just wanted to fight and get laid.
INFP|My youth gave me this real hatred for the average American macho male.
INFP|I would like to get rid of the homophobes, sexists, and racists in our audience. I know they're out there and it really bothers me.

INFP|I like to think that Joy Division doesn't belong to any category.

INFP|One person's craziness is another person's reality.
INFP|I always liked strange characters.
INFP|The thing with him is that he really just focuses on his actors. If the actor says, 'No, I don't feel that's right for the character,' then he takes that so seriously - and not many directors do that in the same way.
INFP|The characters I've played, that I've responded to, there has been a lost-soul quality to them.
INFP|If there's any message to my work, it is ... that it's okay to be different.
INFP|In my career I am doing things that are true to me.

INFP|The only thing I have a problem with is being labeled.
INFP|I've always been in my own world.

INFP|When people tell me I can't do something, I've always been compelled to do it.
INFP|I was always that girl growing up who you could find dancing down supermarket aisles. It's that sense of not feeling inhibited. Dancing in supermarkets is my favorite thing.

INFP|I've looked in my diaries and I only get angry once every seven years so you're safe tonight.

INFP|I didn't like the fact that representatives from Sony Music wanted to okay my tracks because then they're in on the songwriting. And if I start doing that, then I'm dead.

INFP|All my movies are about strange worlds that you can't go into unless you build them and film them. That's what's so important about film to me. I just like going into strange worlds.
INFP|I couldn't and wouldn't work in a studio if I didn't have final cut. ... How could anyone do that? Absolutely pure suicide. Sadness. Ridiculousness. ... Never in a million years. A person's voice is what's critical.
INFP|Spielberg is a very lucky human being, because the things he likes, millions and millions of people like. The things I like, maybe thousands and thousands of people like.
INFP|What I find patronizing is people ... stacking the deck for other people, not respecting their integrity, their difference.

INFP|Terrence Malick loves innocence and anything that celebrates it.
INFP|He's the J.D. Salinger of the movie business.
INFP|I usually accept people on the basis of their self-images, because their self-images have more to do with the way they think than their objective-images do.
INFP|'In the future everyone will be famous for fifteen minutes.' I'm bored with that line. I never use it anymore. My new line is, 'In fifteen minutes everybody will be famous.'

INFP|When you live in a world where normality becomes more regulated ... the need to express yourself ... becomes stronger and stronger.

INFP|I don't believe anyone is ugly.
INFP|A street clown? A juggler? That would be cool. ... I'd go wandering and get lost for a minute, like Jack Kerouac.

INFP|He's a serious, self-effacing young man more interested in art than adulation.
INFP|I'm always ready for my life to change. I'm always waiting for it to change.
INFP|I have a romantic soul.
INFP|Kristen Stewart will decide what she thinks of someone a lot quicker than I will. ... She's like, 'You're an idiot and I don't want to talk to you,' whereas I'm like, 'I'm an idiot too!' So I'll talk to an idiot for days before deciding.

INFP|I'm not ... a big fan of having a linear answer to things.

INFP|He has an intensity that seems to stem from brittle vulnerability.
INFP|He's prone both to blunt honesty and to short, edgy ramblings.

INFP|I take great pride in my soul and the consistency and longevity of my love.
INFP|I definitely identify with the characters I've played, and I really love them for the certain amount of outsider-ness about them.
INFP|With acting you are relying on and waiting on other people. ... To have another outlet that I have full creative control over is really very therapeutic.
INFP|I hated drama class because it felt like ... it was for the loud, outgoing kids. ... But I don't think acting is really about that.
INFP|I found Johnny Depp easy to talk to.

INFP|None of the things that people say about me have anything to do with who I really am.
INFP|I think that creating different environments is an art in itself. ... Thinking of someone like Tim Burton and his films - he has had his own singular vision.
INFP|I'm not great at communicating my vision - I think I use fragments instead of full sentences. Or when I try to explain ... it comes out wrong.
INFP|Robert Altman told me that as a person I disappear in a way. On film, I'm very mysterious, but in life ... I don't put forth a lot.

INFP|I'm vulnerable and goofy and dopey.
INFP|I want to show women I'm not like every other guy. Because I hate other men.
INFP|Mayer has a childlike lucidity about him, as if he never outgrew the candor and wonder that comes with being 12 years old.
INFP|As a writer, you are often told: 'Write about what you know.' But Kafka didn't. Gogol didn't. Did Shakespeare write only what he knew? Did Camus? Our own selves are limitless.
INFP|I've never really felt a strong line ... between childhood and adulthood. ... I don't know if I'm missing some big thing that happened to all adults that skipped me. I somehow doubt it.
INFP|The world demands ... business ... customer service ... they want your heart. ... Our society asks for the segregation of self.
INFP|My work is obviously personal - it's through me, it's my imagination, it's my emotions, I feel very, very connected to it.
INFP|Spektor's music is in no way 'affected.' She really is like that: funny, friendly, brainy, sincere, scatty and disconcertingly girlish.
INFP|The one thing you have is your uniqueness.
INFP|Cool, to me, is following what you believe in.
INFP|Though some of the things I do can come across nerdy or unprofessional, it's at least true to me.
INFP|The only thing you can rely on is not being false. That's really my only rule.
INFP|He is a sensitive soul.
INFP|Decisions which result in human suffering should never have empathy removed from the equation. ... Those ... who lack empathy should not be permitted to have any power.

INFP|I tend to be a bit quiet, a touch avoidant. ... I never dreamed about being in a limo or being backstage with loads of girls. I only visualized playing very well and enjoying it.

INFP|I am a fragile flower.
INFP|He's a seriously emotional soul.
INFP|I think I'm rather more of a lion, circa 20 or 30 AD, when Christians were in plentiful supply. I've always thought of Hugh as a panda, probably because he's not naturally aggressive.
INFP|He is given to long answers that deviate from the question and frequently end with him asking questions of himself.
INFP|Spending time alone led the young Laurie to develop a vivid fantasy life, which he says made it extremely easy to imagine himself in other lives. It's something which still accompanies him today and he says he doesn't know what he would do without it.
INFP|With movies, what I really loved was moments and tones and feelings in a scene, and I loved creating those.
INFP|I never viewed money as being 'my money,' I always saw it as 'the money.' ... If it pools up around me then it needs to be flushed back out into the system.
INFP|There's been a lot of simple vilification of right-wing people. It's really easy to say, ... 'You're anti-this and that, and I hate you.' But to me, it's more interesting to say, 'What is this person like and how do they really think?'
INFP|When I read that the foundations of capitalism are shattering, I'm like: 'Maybe we need that. Maybe we need some time where we're walking around with a donkey with pots clanging on the sides.'

INFP|I really like people, but I also have a deep discomfort with being in society.
INFP|Damaged people are very interesting.

INFP|I live in my own little world ... hoping that every once in while, something really beautiful will gleam out like a penny in the sand. ... That's what I live for.
INFP|My love of gothic ideas ... seems inborn; I loved Shakespeare's 'Macbeth' and Poe's short stories from the first page of them I turned.
INFP|As a kid ... I cared about the dark side of things. I had no interest in comedy, I still don't. That's more Penn's thing.
INFP|The thing I dislike most in magic is piracy. I know how many years can go into one beautiful idea. And to see somebody simply lift that idea (invariably doing it badly or insincerely) makes my blood boil.
INFP|Penn and Teller appear utterly incompatible: the tall shouty one who thinks and laughs; the small quiet one who feels and cries.

INFP|I have always had an unwavering curiosity about people - what they feel ... how they're motivated. ... I have always made it my business to find out. ... I am endlessly absorbed by human motivations.
INFP|I'm determined to know ... the quirks that people have. I have tried to ... learn their potential for loving, for hating ... how they were truly constituted.
INFP|The military ... wants the same predictability in a man as they do in a telephone or a machine gun. ... To regiment people - to make them march in step, all in uniform ... is nauseating to me.
INFP|In the company of children Brando is at ease, playful, appreciative ... a co-conspirator.
INFP|I'm discerning, but not in terms of what other people ... think. I am discerning ... in terms of my own aesthetic and what I like.

INFP|I always felt really overwhelmed ... by the desire not to end up in an office, doing something I don't believe in.
INFP|She has a quality that is hard to pin down. ... She is a person into whom you can read a lot.
INFP|She has a dreamy apartness.
INFP|I honestly have no interest in celebrity whatsoever. If anything, I always cringe at it because it takes away from what I am.
INFP|I would never know how to sell myself as a sex symbol. That's not how I'm programmed.
INFP|It's a bit of a minefield being 20 because you've got all these aspirations and ideals. Well, I had.
INFP|I've always liked what Thomas More said in 'Utopia': ... Every person is allowed their own lifestyle ... but no one is allowed to stand on a soapbox and tell others that theirs is right. I thought that was brilliant.
ENFP|I was never idle long enough to do much thinking, but I felt somehow that my instincts were right.
ENFP|When the going gets weird, the weird turn pro.
ENFP|I have a theory that the truth is never told during the nine-to-five hours.

ENFP|Who prays for Satan? Who, in eighteen centuries, has had the common humanity to pray for the one sinner that needed it most?

ENFP|America had often been discovered before Columbus, but it had always been hushed up.

ENFP|Genius is to carry the spirit of the child into old age, which means never losing your enthusiasm.

ENFP|In my writing I know that I have made a caricature out of others' academic theories but I think that caricatures are frequently good portraits.
ENFP|I am fascinated by stupidity because normal intelligence is boring. Two plus two makes four - finished. You have no possibilities! Stupidity is infinite. Two plus two can make billions of different numbers.
ENFP|Socrates ... did not write. It seems academically obvious that he perished because he did not publish!
ENFP|Umberto Eco is the owner of a large personal library of almost 30,000 books that he has not read. To him read books are far less valuable than unread ones.

ENFP|In literature I hope to find not absolute truth but the truth of the tale, of the imagination of the heart.
ENFP|My work is a love song to our mongrel selves.
ENFP|Free speech is the whole thing, the whole ball game. Free speech is life itself.

ENFP|I enjoy helping people who are vulnerable.
ENFP|The only true aging is the erosion of one's ideals.

ENFP|The only difference between the Republican Party and the Democratic Party is the velocity with which their knees hit the floor when the big corporations come asking.
ENFP|It's a wonder I haven't abandoned all my ideals, they seem so absurd and impractical. Yet I cling to them because I still believe, in spite of everything, that people are truly good at heart.
ENFP|During the third class my teacher had finally had enough. 'Anne Frank, as punishment for talking so much you will write an essay entitled, 'Quack, Quack, Quack, Said Miss Chatterback.''

ENFP|The only difference between Bush and Hitler is that Hitler was elected.
ENFP|Vonnegut was much like Mark Twain in outlook. He loved life and had high ideals which often caused him disappointment.

ENFP|Communication is my thing.
ENFP|We are looking to corporate brands for poetry and for spirituality, because we're not getting those things from our communities or from each other.

ENFP|I love language as I love life itself!
ENFP|I say things that contradict each other, that are in real tension with each other, that compose me, that make me live, and that will make me die.

ENFP|If you tremble with indignation at every injustice, then you are a comrade of mine.
ENFP|At the risk of seeming ridiculous, let me say that the true revolutionary is guided by a great feeling of love. It is impossible to think of a genuine revolutionary lacking this quality.

ENFP|I have mourned comrade Stalin.
ENFP|Che stands up as the perennial Icarus, a self-immolating figure who represents the romantic tragedy of youth.

ENFP|I do believe that he deserves it, but for it to be given right now ... is sycophancy and premature.
